<p>OpenAI is awarding a $1 million grant to a Duke University research team to look at how AI could predict human moral judgments.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.eweek.com/news/openai-funding-ai-morality-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initiative</a> highlights the growing focus on the intersection of technology and ethics, and raises critical questions: Can AI handle the complexities of morality, or should ethical decisions remain the domain of humans?</p>



<p>Duke University’s Moral Attitudes and Decisions Lab (MADLAB), led by ethics professor Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and co-investigator Jana Schaich Borg, is in charge of the “Making Moral AI” project. The team envisions a “moral GPS,” a tool that could guide ethical decision-making.</p>



<p>Its research spans diverse fields, including computer science, philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, to understand how moral attitudes and decisions are formed and how AI can contribute to the process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The role of AI in morality</h3>



<p>MADLAB’s work examines how AI might predict or influence moral judgments. Imagine an algorithm assessing ethical dilemmas, such as deciding between two unfavourable outcomes in autonomous vehicles or providing guidance on ethical business practices. Such scenarios underscore AI’s potential but also raise fundamental questions: Who determines the moral framework guiding these types of tools, and should AI be trusted to make decisions with ethical implications?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">OpenAI’s vision</h3>



<p>The grant supports the development of algorithms that forecast human moral judgments in areas such as medical, law, and business, which frequently involve complex ethical trade-offs. While promising, AI still struggles to grasp the emotional and cultural nuances of morality. Current systems excel at recognising patterns but lack the deeper understanding required for ethical reasoning.</p>



<p>Another concern is how this technology might be applied. While AI could assist in life-saving decisions, its use in defence strategies or surveillance introduces moral dilemmas. Can unethical AI actions be justified if they serve national interests or align with societal goals? These questions emphasise the difficulties of embedding morality into AI systems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges and opportunities</h3>



<p>Integrating ethics into AI is a formidable challenge that requires collaboration across disciplines. Morality is not universal; it is shaped by cultural, personal, and societal values, making it difficult to encode into algorithms. Additionally, without safeguards such as transparency and accountability, there is a risk of perpetuating biases or enabling harmful applications.</p>



<p>OpenAI’s investment in Duke’s research marks at step toward understanding the role of AI in ethical decision-making. However, the journey is far from over. Developers and policymakers must work together to ensure that AI tools align with social values, and emphasise fairness and inclusivity while addressing biases and unintended consequences.</p>



<p>As AI becomes more integral to decision-making, its ethical implications demand attention. Projects like “Making Moral AI” offer a starting point for navigating a complex landscape, balancing innovation with responsibility in order to shape a future where technology serves the greater good.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-gb/">CrowdStrike</a> commissioned a survey of 1,022 cybersecurity professionals worldwide to assess their views on generative AI (GenAI) adoption and its implications.</p>



<p>The findings reveal enthusiasm for GenAI’s potential to bolster defences against increasingly sophisticated threats, but also trepidation over risks such as data exposure and attacks on GenAI systems.</p>



<p>While much has been speculated about the transformative impact of GenAI, the survey’s results paint a clearer picture of how practitioners are thinking about its role in cybersecurity.</p>



<p>According to the report, “We’re entering the era of GenAI in cybersecurity.” However, as organisations adopt this promising technology, their success will hinge on ensuring the safe, responsible, and industry-specific deployment of GenAI tools.</p>



<p>CrowdStrike’s research reveals five pivotal findings that shape the current state of GenAI in cybersecurity:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Platform-based GenAI is favoured </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>80% of respondents indicated a preference for GenAI delivered through integrated cybersecurity platforms rather than standalone tools. Seamless integration is cited as a crucial factor, with many preferring tools that work cohesively with existing systems. “GenAI’s value is linked to how well it works within the broader technology ecosystem,” the report states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, almost two-thirds (63%) of those surveyed expressed willingness to switch security vendors to access GenAI capabilities from competitors. The survey underscores the industry’s readiness for unified platforms that streamline operations and reduce the complexity of adopting new point solutions.</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>GenAI built by cybersecurity experts is a must</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Security teams believe GenAI tools should be specifically designed for cybersecurity, not general-purpose systems. 83% of respondents reported they would not trust tools that provide “unsuitable or ill-advised security guidance.”</p>



<p>Breach prevention remains a key motivator, with 74% stating they had faced breaches within the past 18 months or were concerned about vulnerabilities. Respondents prioritised tools from vendors with proven expertise in cybersecurity, incident response, and threat intelligence over suppliers with broad AI leadership alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As CrowdStrike summarised, “The emphasis on breach prevention and vendor expertise suggests security teams would avoid domain-agnostic GenAI tools.”</p>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Augmentation, not replacement </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Despite growing fears of automation replacing jobs in many industries, the survey’s findings indicate minimal concerns about job displacement in cybersecurity. Instead, respondents expect GenAI to empower security analysts by automating repetitive tasks, reducing burnout, onboarding new personnel faster, and accelerating decision-making.</p>



<p>GenAI’s potential for augmenting analysts’ workflows was underscored by its most requested applications: threat intelligence analysis, assistance with investigations, and automated response mechanisms. As noted in the report, “Respondents overwhelmingly believe GenAI will ultimately optimise the analyst experience, not replace human labour.”</p>



<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>ROI outweighs cost concerns  </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>For organisations evaluating GenAI investments, measurable return on investment (ROI) is the paramount concern, ahead of licensing costs or pricing model confusion. Respondents expect platform-led GenAI deployments to deliver faster results, thanks to cost savings from reduced tool management burdens, streamlined training, and fewer security incidents.</p>



<p>According to the survey data, the expected ROI breakdown includes 31% from cost optimisation and more efficient tools, 30% from fewer incidents, and 26% from reduced management time. Security leaders are clearly focused on ensuring the financial justification for GenAI investments.</p>



<ol start="5" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Guardrails and safety are crucial </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>GenAI adoption is tempered by concerns around safety and privacy, with 87% of organisations either implementing or planning new security policies to oversee GenAI use. Key risks include exposing sensitive data to large language models (LLMs) and adversarial attacks on GenAI tools. Respondents rank safety and privacy controls among their most desired GenAI features, highlighting the need for responsible implementation.</p>



<p>Reflecting the cautious optimism of practitioners, only 39% of respondents firmly believed that the rewards of GenAI outweigh its risks. Meanwhile, 40% considered the risks and rewards “comparable.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Current state of GenAI adoption in cybersecurity</h3>



<p>GenAI adoption remains in its early stages, but interest is growing. 64% of respondents are actively researching or have already invested in GenAI tools, and 69% of those currently evaluating their options plan to make a purchase within the year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Security teams are primarily driven by three concerns: improving attack detection and response, enhancing operational efficiency, and mitigating the impact of staff shortages. Among economic considerations, the top priority is ROI – a sign that security leaders are keen to demonstrate tangible benefits to justify their spending.</p>



<p>CrowdStrike emphasises the importance of a platform-based approach, where GenAI is integrated into a unified system. Such platforms enable seamless adoption, measurable benefits, and safety guardrails for responsible usage. According to the report, “The future of GenAI in cybersecurity will be defined by tools that not only advance security but also uphold the highest standards of safety and privacy.”</p>



<p>The CrowdStrike survey concludes by affirming that “GenAI is not a silver bullet” but has tremendous potential to improve cybersecurity outcomes. As organisations evaluate its adoption, they will prioritise tools that integrate seamlessly with existing platforms, deliver faster response times, and ensure safety and privacy compliance.</p>



<p>With threats becoming more sophisticated, the role of GenAI in enabling security teams to work faster and smarter could prove indispensable. While still in its infancy, GenAI in cybersecurity is poised to shift from early adoption to mainstream deployment, provided organisations and vendors address its risks responsibly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.netapp.com/">NetApp</a> has shed light on the pressing issues faced by organisations globally as they strive to optimise their strategies for AI success.</p>



<p>“2025 is shaping up to be a defining year for AI, as organisations transition from experimentation to scaling their AI capabilities,” said Gabie Boko, NetApp’s Chief Marketing Officer.</p>



<p>“Businesses are making significant investments to drive innovation and efficiency, but these efforts will succeed only if global tech executives can address the mounting challenges of data complexity, security, and sustainability.”</p>



<p>The findings of NetApp’s latest <em>Data Complexity Report</em> paints a detailed picture of where businesses currently stand on their AI journeys and the key trends that will shape the technology’s future.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cost of transformation</h3>



<p>Two-thirds of businesses worldwide claim their data is &#8220;fully or mostly optimised&#8221; for AI purposes, highlighting vast improvements in making data accessible, accurate, and well-documented. Yet, the study reveals that the journey towards AI maturity requires further significant investment.</p>



<p>A striking 40% of global technology executives anticipate “unprecedented investment” will be necessary in 2025 just to enhance AI and data management capabilities.</p>



<p>While considerable progress has been made, achieving impactful breakthroughs demands an even greater commitment in financial and infrastructural resources. Catching up with AI&#8217;s potential might not come cheap, but leaders prepared to invest could reap significant rewards in innovation and efficiency.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Data silos impede AI success</h3>



<p>One of the principal barriers identified in the report is the fragmentation of data. An overwhelming 79% of global tech executives state that unifying their data, reducing silos and ensuring smooth interconnectedness, is key to unlocking AI’s full potential.</p>



<p>Companies that have embraced unified data storage are better placed to overcome this hurdle. By connecting data regardless of its type or location (across hybrid multi-cloud environments,) they ensure constant accessibility and minimise fragmentation.</p>



<p>The report indicates that organisations prioritising data unification are significantly more likely to meet their AI goals in 2025. Nearly one-third (30%) of businesses failing to prioritise unification foresee missing their targets, compared to just 23% for those placing this at the heart of their strategy.</p>



<p>Executives have doubled down on data management and infrastructure as top priorities, increasingly recognising that optimising their capacity to gather, store, and process information is essential for AI maturity. Companies refusing to tackle these data challenges risk falling behind in an intensely competitive global market.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Scaling risks of AI</h3>



<p>As businesses accelerate their AI adoption, the associated risks – particularly around <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/categories/ai-security/">security</a> – are becoming more acute. More than two-fifths (41%) of global tech executives predict a stark rise in security threats by 2025 as AI becomes integral to more facets of their operations.</p>



<p>AI’s rapid rise has expanded attack surfaces, exposing data sets to new vulnerabilities and creating unique challenges such as protecting sensitive AI models. Countries leading the AI race, including India, the US, and Japan, are nearly twice as likely to encounter escalating security concerns compared to less AI-advanced nations like Germany, France, and Spain.</p>



<p>Increased awareness of AI-driven security challenges is reflected in business priorities. Over half (59%) of global executives name cybersecurity as one of the top stressors confronting organisations today.</p>



<p>However, progress is being made. Despite elevated concerns, the report suggests that effective security measures are yielding results. Since 2023, the number of executives ranking cybersecurity and ransomware protection as their top priority has fallen by 17%, signalling optimism in combating these risks effectively.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Limiting AI’s environmental costs</h3>



<p>Beyond security risks, AI’s growth is raising urgent questions of sustainability. Over one-third of global technology executives (34%) predict that AI advancements will drive significant changes to corporate sustainability practices. Meanwhile, 33% foresee new government policies and investments targeting energy usage.</p>



<p>The infrastructure powering AI and transforming raw data into business value demands significant energy, counteracting organisational sustainability targets. AI-heavy nations often feel the environmental impact more acutely than their less AI-focused counterparts.</p>



<p>While 72% of businesses still prioritise carbon footprint reduction, the report notes a decline from 84% in 2023, pointing to increasing tension between sustainability commitments and the relentless march of innovation. For organisations to scale AI without causing irreparable damage to the planet, maintaining environmental responsibility alongside technological growth will be paramount in coming years.</p>



<p>Krish Vitaldevara, SVP and GM at NetApp, commented: “The organisations leading in advanced analytics and AI are those that have unified and well-cataloged data, robust security and compliance for sensitive information, and a clear understanding of how data evolves.</p>



<p>“By tackling these challenges, they can drive innovation while ensuring resilience, responsibility, and timely insights in the new AI era.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Salesforce has unveiled the findings of its <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/uk/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/12/Salesforce-UK-AI-Readiness-Index.pdf">UK AI Readiness Index</a>, signalling the nation is in a position to spearhead the next wave of AI innovation, also known as agentic AI.</p>



<p>The report places the UK ahead of its G7 counterparts in terms of AI adoption but also underscores areas ripe for improvement, such as support for SMEs, fostering cross-sector partnerships, and investing in talent development.</p>



<p>Zahra Bahrololoumi CBE, UKI CEO at Salesforce, commented: “Agentic AI is revolutionising enterprise software by enabling humans and agents to collaborate seamlessly and drive customer success.</p>



<p>“The UK AI Readiness Index positively highlights that the UK has both the vision and infrastructure to be a powerhouse globally in AI, and lead the current third wave of agentic AI.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">UK AI adoption sets the stage for agentic revolution</h3>



<p>The Index details how both the public and private sectors in the UK have embraced AI&#8217;s transformative potential. With a readiness score of 65.5, surpassing the G7 average of 61.2, the UK is establishing itself as a hub for large-scale AI projects, driven by a robust innovation culture and pragmatic regulatory approaches.</p>



<p>The government has played its part in maintaining a stable and secure environment for tech investment. Initiatives such as the <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/uk-reveals-ai-safety-summit-opening-day-agenda/">AI Safety Summit</a> at Bletchley Park and risk-oriented AI legislation showcase Britain&#8217;s leadership on critical AI issues like transparency and privacy.</p>



<p>Business readiness is equally impressive, with UK industries scoring 52, well above the G7 average of 47.8. SMEs in the UK are increasingly prioritising AI adoption, further bolstering the nation&#8217;s stance in the international AI arena.</p>



<p>Adam Evans, EVP &amp; GM of Salesforce AI Platform, is optimistic about the evolution of agentic AI. Evans foresees that, by 2025, these agents will become business-aware—expertly navigating industry-specific challenges to execute meaningful tasks and decisions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Investments fuelling AI growth</h3>



<p>Salesforce is committing $4 billion to the UK’s AI ecosystem over the next five years. Since establishing its UK AI Centre in London, Salesforce says it has engaged over 3,000 stakeholders in AI training and workshops.</p>



<p>Key investment focuses include creating a regulatory bridge between the EU’s <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/balancing-innovation-trust-experts-assess-eu-ai-act/">rules-based approach</a> and the more relaxed US approach, and ensuring SMEs have the resources to integrate AI. A strong emphasis also lies on enhancing digital skills and centralising training to support the AI workforce of the future.</p>



<p>Feryal Clark, Minister for AI and Digital Government, said: &#8220;These findings are further proof the UK is in prime position to take advantage of AI, and highlight our strength in spurring innovation, investment, and collaboration across the public and private sector.</p>



<p>“There is a global race for AI and we’ll be setting out plans for how the UK can use the technology to ramp-up adoption across the economy, kickstart growth, and build an AI sector which can scale and compete on the global stage.”</p>



<p>Antony Walker, Deputy CEO at techUK, added: “To build this progress, government and industry must collaborate to foster innovation, support SMEs, invest in skills, and ensure flexible regulation, cementing the UK’s leadership in the global AI economy.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Agentic AI boosting UK business productivity&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Capita, Secret Escapes, Heathrow, and Bionic are among the organisations that have adopted Salesforce’s Agentforce to boost their productivity.</p>



<p>Adolfo Hernandez, CEO of Capita, said: &#8220;We want to transform Capita’s recruitment process into a fast, seamless and autonomous experience that benefits candidates, our people, and our clients.</p>



<p>“With autonomous agents providing 24/7 support, our goal is to enable candidates to complete the entire recruitment journey within days as opposed to what has historically taken weeks.</p>



<p>Secret Escapes, a curator of luxury travel deals, finds autonomous agents crucial for personalising services to its 60 million European members.</p>



<p>Kate Donaghy, Head of Business Technology at Secret Escapes, added: “Agentforce uses our unified data to automate routine tasks like processing cancellations, updating booking information, or even answering common travel questions about luggage, flight information, and much more—freeing up our customer service agents to handle more complex and last-minute travel needs to better serve our members.”</p>



<p>The UK’s AI readiness is testament to the synergy between government, business, and academia. To maintain its leadership, the UK must sustain its focus on collaboration, skills development, and innovation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OpenAI and other leading AI companies are developing new training techniques to overcome limitations of current methods. Addressing unexpected delays and complications in the development of larger, more powerful language models, these fresh techniques focus on human-like behaviour to teach algorithms to &#8216;think.</p>



<p>Reportedly led by a dozen AI researchers, scientists, and investors, the new training techniques, which underpin OpenAI&#8217;s recent <a href="https://openai.com/o1/">&#8216;o1&#8217; model</a> (formerly Q* and Strawberry), have the potential to transform the landscape of AI development. The reported advances may influence the types or quantities of resources AI companies need continuously, including specialised hardware and energy to aid the development of AI models.</p>



<p>The o1 model is designed to approach problems in a way that mimics human reasoning and thinking, breaking down numerous tasks into steps. The model also utilises specialised data and feedback provided by experts in the AI industry to enhance its performance.</p>



<p>Since ChatGPT was unveiled by OpenAI in 2022, there has been a surge in AI innovation, and many technology companies claim existing AI models require expansion, be it through greater quantities of data or improved computing resources. Only then can AI models consistently improve.</p>



<p>Now, AI experts have reported limitations in scaling up AI models. The 2010s were a revolutionary period for scaling, but Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, says that the training of AI models, particularly in the understanding language structures and patterns, has levelled off.</p>



<p>&#8220;The 2010s were the age of scaling, now we&#8217;re back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Scaling the right thing matters more now,&#8221; they said.</p>



<p>In recent times, AI lab researchers have experienced delays in and challenges to developing and releasing large language models (LLM) that are more powerful than OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-4 model.</p>



<p>First, there is the cost of training large models, often running into tens of millions of dollars. And, due to complications that arise, like hardware failing due to system complexity, a final analysis of how these models run can take months.</p>



<p>In addition to these challenges, training runs require substantial amounts of energy, often resulting in power shortages that can disrupt processes and impact the wider electriciy grid. Another issue is the colossal amount of data large language models use, so much so that AI models have reportedly used up all accessible data worldwide.</p>



<p>Researchers are exploring a technique known as &#8216;test-time compute&#8217; to improve current AI models when being trained or during inference phases. The method can involve the generation of multiple answers in real-time to decide on a range of best solutions. Therefore, the model can allocate greater processing resources to difficult tasks that require human-like decision-making and reasoning. The aim &#8211; to make the model more accurate and capable.</p>



<p>Noam Brown, a researcher at OpenAI who helped develop the o1 model, shared an example of how a new approach can achieve surprising results. At the TED AI conference in San Francisco last month, Brown explained that &#8220;having a bot think for just 20 seconds in a hand of poker got the same boosting performance as scaling up the model by 100,000x and training it for 100,000 times longer.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rather than simply increasing the model size and training time, this can change how AI models process information and lead to more powerful, efficient systems.</p>



<p>It is reported that other AI labs have been developing versions of the o1 technique. The include <a href="https://x.ai/">xAI</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.google/">Google DeepMind</a>, and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>. Competition in the AI world is nothing new, but we could see a significant impact on the AI hardware market as a result of new techniques. Companies like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/">Nvidia</a>, which currently dominates the supply of AI chips due to the high demand for their products, may be particularly affected by updated AI training techniques.</p>



<p>Nvidia became the world&#8217;s most valuable company in October, and its rise in fortunes can be largely attributed to its chips&#8217; use in AI arrays. New techniques may impact Nvidia&#8217;s market position, forcing the company to adapt its products to meet the evolving AI hardware demand. Potentially, this could open more avenues for new competitors in the inference market.</p>



<p>A new age of AI development may be on the horizon, driven by evolving hardware demands and more efficient training methods such as those deployed in the o1 model. The future of both AI models and the companies behind them could be reshaped, unlocking unprecedented possibilities and greater competition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A report by <a href="https://www.publicissapient.com/">Publicis Sapient</a> sheds light on the disparities between the C-suite and practitioners, dubbed the &#8220;V-suite,&#8221; in their perceptions and adoption of generative AI.</p>



<p>The report reveals a stark contrast in how the C-suite and V-suite view the potential of generative AI. While the C-suite focuses on visible use cases such as customer experience, service, and sales, the V-suite sees opportunities across various functional areas, including operations, HR, and finance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Risk perception</h3>



<p>The divide extends to risk perception as well. Fifty-one percent of C-level respondents expressed more concern about the risk and ethics of generative AI than other emerging technologies. In contrast, only 23 percent of the V-suite shared these worries.</p>



<p>Simon James, Managing Director of Data &amp; AI at Publicis Sapient, said: “It’s likely the C-suite is more worried about abstract, big-picture dangers – such as Hollywood-style scenarios of a rapidly-evolving superintelligence – than the V-suite.”</p>



<p>The report also highlights the uncertainty surrounding generative AI maturity. Organisations can be at various stages of maturity simultaneously, with many struggling to define what success looks like. More than two-thirds of respondents lack a way to measure the success of their generative AI projects.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Navigating the generative AI landscape</h3>



<p>Despite the C-suite&#8217;s focus on high-visibility use cases, generative AI is quietly transforming back-office functions. More than half of the V-suite respondents ranked generative AI as extremely important in areas like finance and operations over the next three years, compared to a smaller percentage of the C-suite.</p>



<p>To harness the full potential of generative AI, the report recommends a portfolio approach to innovation projects. Leaders should focus on delivering projects, controlling shadow IT, avoiding duplication, empowering domain experts, connecting business units with the CIO&#8217;s office, and engaging the risk office early and often.</p>



<p>Daniel Liebermann, Managing Director at Publicis Sapient, commented: &#8220;It&#8217;s as hard for leaders to learn how individuals within their organisation are using ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot as it is to understand how they&#8217;re using the internet.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The path forward</h3>



<p>The report concludes with five steps to maximise innovation: adopting a portfolio approach, improving communication between the CIO&#8217;s office and the risk office, seeking out innovators within the organisation, using generative AI to manage information, and empowering team members through company culture and upskilling.</p>



<p>As generative AI continues to evolve, organisations must bridge the gap between the C-suite and V-suite to unlock its full potential. The future of business transformation lies in harnessing the power of a decentralised, bottom-up approach to innovation.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://institute.global/">Tony Blair Institute</a> (TBI) has examined AI&#8217;s impact on the workforce. The report outlines AI’s potential to reshape work environments, boost productivity, and create opportunities—while warning of potential challenges ahead.</p>



<p>&#8220;Technology has a long history of profoundly reshaping the world of work,&#8221; the report begins.</p>



<p>From the agricultural revolution to the digital age, each wave of innovation has redefined labour markets. Today, AI presents a seismic shift, advancing rapidly and prompting policymakers to prepare for change.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Economic opportunities</h3>



<p>The TBI report estimates that AI, when fully adopted by UK firms, could significantly increase productivity. It suggests that AI could save &#8220;almost a quarter of private-sector workforce time,&#8221; equivalent to the annual output of 6 million workers.</p>



<p>Most of these time savings are expected to stem from AI-enabled software performing cognitive tasks such as data analysis and routine administrative operations.</p>



<p>The report identifies sectors reliant on routine cognitive tasks, such as banking and finance, as those with significant exposure to AI. However, sectors like skilled trades or construction – which involve complex manual tasks – are likely to see less direct impact.</p>



<p>While AI can result in initial job losses, it also has the potential to create new demand by fostering economic growth and new industries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report expects these job losses can be balanced by new job creation. Over the years, technology has historically spurred new employment opportunities, as innovation leads to the development of new products and services.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Shaping future generations</h3>



<p>AI’s potential extends into education, where it could assist both teachers and students.</p>



<p>The report suggests that AI could help &#8220;raise educational attainment by around six percent&#8221; on average. By personalising and supporting learning, AI has the potential to equalise access to opportunities and improve the quality of the workforce over time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Health and wellbeing</h3>



<p>Beyond education, AI offers potential benefits in healthcare, supporting a healthier workforce and reducing welfare costs.</p>



<p>The report highlights AI’s role in speeding medical research, enabling preventive healthcare, and helping those with disabilities re-enter the workforce.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Workplace transformation</h3>



<p>The report acknowledges potential workplace challenges, such as increased monitoring and stress from AI tools. It stresses the importance of managing these technologies thoughtfully to &#8220;deliver a more engaging, inclusive and safe working environment.&#8221;</p>



<p>To mitigate potential disruption, the TBI outlines recommendations. These include upgrading labour-market infrastructure and utilising AI for job matching.</p>



<p>The report suggests creating an &#8220;Early Awareness and Opportunity System&#8221; to help workers understand the impact of AI on their jobs and provide advice on career paths.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Preparing for an AI-powered future</h3>



<p>In light of the uncertainties surrounding AI’s impact on the workforce, the TBI urges policy changes to maximise benefits. Recommendations include incentivising AI adoption across industries, developing AI-pathfinder programmes, and creating challenge prizes to address public-sector labour shortages.</p>



<p>The report concludes that while AI presents risks, the potential gains are too significant to ignore.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/categories/ai-legislation-government/">Policymakers</a> are encouraged to adopt a &#8220;pro-innovation&#8221; stance while being attuned to the risks, fostering an economy that is dynamic and resilient.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A global study has unveiled a stark contrast in attitudes towards embracing in-vehicle AI between Eastern and Western markets, with European drivers particularly reluctant.</p>



<p>The research – conducted by <a href="https://www.mhp.com/">MHP</a> – surveyed 4,700 car drivers across China, the US, Germany, the UK, Italy, Sweden, and Poland, revealing significant geographical disparities in AI acceptance and understanding.</p>



<p>According to the study, while AI is becoming integral to modern vehicles, European consumers remain hesitant about its implementation and value proposition.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Regional disparities</h3>



<p>The study found that 48 percent of Chinese respondents view in-car AI predominantly as an opportunity, while merely 23 percent of European respondents share this optimistic outlook. In Europe, 39 percent believe AI&#8217;s opportunities and risks are broadly balanced, while 24 percent take a negative stance, suggesting the risks outweigh potential benefits.</p>



<p>Understanding of AI technology also varies significantly by region. While over 80 percent of Chinese respondents claim to understand AI&#8217;s use in cars, this figure drops to just 54 percent among European drivers, highlighting a notable knowledge gap.</p>



<p>Marcus Willand, Partner at MHP and one of the study&#8217;s authors, notes: &#8220;The figures show that the prospect of greater safety and comfort due to AI can motivate purchasing decisions. However, the European respondents in particular are often hesitant and price-sensitive.&#8221;</p>



<p>The willingness to pay for AI features shows an equally stark divide. Just 23 percent of European drivers expressed willingness to pay for AI functions, compared to 39 percent of Chinese drivers. The study suggests that most users now expect AI features to be standard rather than optional extras.</p>

<p>Dr Nils Schaupensteiner, Associated Partner at MHP and study co-author, said: &#8220;Automotive companies need to create innovations with clear added value and develop both direct and indirect monetisation of their AI offerings, for example through data-based business models and improved services.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In-vehicle AI opportunities</h3>



<p>Despite these challenges, traditional automotive manufacturers maintain a trust advantage over tech giants. The study reveals that 64 percent of customers trust established car manufacturers with AI implementation, compared to 50 percent for technology firms like Apple, Google, and Microsoft.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="746" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-1024x746.jpg" alt="Graph highlighting the public trust in various stakeholders regarding in-vehicle AI." class="wp-image-16439" srcset="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-1024x746.jpg 1024w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-300x219.jpg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-768x560.jpg 768w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-1536x1119.jpg 1536w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-274x200.jpg 274w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-380x277.jpg 380w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-343x250.jpg 343w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-100x73.jpg 100w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-60x44.jpg 60w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust.jpg 1821w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The research identified several key areas where AI could provide significant value across the automotive industry&#8217;s value chain, including pattern recognition for quality management, enhanced data management capabilities, AI-driven decision-making systems, and improved customer service through AI-powered communication tools.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is worth OEMs and suppliers considering the opportunities offered by the new technology along their entire value chain,&#8221; explains Augustin Friedel, Senior Manager and study co-author. &#8220;However, the possible uses are diverse and implementation is quite complex.&#8221;</p>



<p>The study reveals that <a href="https://iottechnews.com/news/nearly-80-percent-us-motorists-ai-voice-assistants/">while up to 79 percent</a> of respondents express interest in AI-powered features such as driver assistance systems, intelligent route planning, and predictive maintenance, manufacturers face significant challenges in monetising these capabilities, particularly in the European market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> (OSI) has unveiled a definition framework to evaluate whether AI systems can be classified as open-source.</p>



<p>The announcement of the first Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) was made at <a href="https://allthingsopen.org/">All Things Open</a> and marks the culmination of a comprehensive global effort spanning multiple years of research, international workshops, and a year-long community design process.</p>



<p>The OSI – widely recognised as the definitive authority on open-source definitions by individuals, organisations, and government bodies worldwide – developed the framework through extensive collaboration with industry stakeholders. This framework defines what open-source AI means, insisting that the same open-source requirements apply whether to a fully functional AI system, a model, weights and parameters, or other structural elements.</p>



<p>An open-source AI system must be made available under terms that grant four essential freedoms:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Use the system for any purpose</strong> and without having to ask for permission.</li>



<li><strong>Study how the system works</strong> and inspect its components.</li>



<li><strong>Modify the system</strong> for any purpose, including to change its output.</li>



<li><strong>Share the system</strong> for others to use with or without modifications, for any purpose.</li>
</ul>



<p>These freedoms apply both to a fully functional system and to discrete elements of a system. A precondition to exercising these freedoms is having access to the preferred form to make modifications to the system, which includes detailed data information, complete source code, and model parameters.</p>



<p>&#8220;The co-design process that led to version 1.0 of the Open Source AI Definition was well-developed, thorough, inclusive, and fair,&#8221; said Carlo Piana, OSI board chair. &#8220;The board is confident that the process has resulted in a definition that meets the standards of open-source as defined in the open-source definition and the four essential freedoms.&#8221;</p>



<p>One of the framework&#8217;s most significant requirements is the mandate for open-source models to provide sufficient information about <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/penguin-random-house-protects-its-books-from-ai-training-use/">their training data</a>, ensuring that &#8220;a skilled person can recreate a substantially equivalent system using the same or similar data,&#8221; according to Ayah Bdeir, who leads AI strategy at <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/">Mozilla</a>.</p>



<p>Bdeir acknowledged that whilst this approach might not be perfect, it represents a practical compromise between ideological purity and real-world implementation. She suggested that demanding an unrealistically high standard could prove counterproductive to the initiative&#8217;s goals.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/implement">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a> (DPGA) has expressed support for the OSI&#8217;s leadership in defining open-source AI. Liv Marte Nordhaug, CEO of the DPGA secretariat, confirmed that her organisation will incorporate this foundational work into updates to their Digital Public Goods Standard for AI applications.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.eleuther.ai/">EleutherAI Institute</a>, known for its non-profit work in AI development, has also endorsed the definition.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Open Source AI Definition is a necessary step towards promoting the benefits of open-source principles in the field of AI,&#8221; stated Stella Biderman, Executive Director of the EleutherAI Institute. &#8220;We believe that this definition supports the needs of independent machine learning researchers and promotes greater transparency among the largest AI developers.&#8221;</p>



<p>The definition highlights the importance of including data information and code when sharing open-source models and weights. These requirements ensure transparency and the ability to modify the AI system.</p>



<p>OSI Executive Director Stefano Maffulli acknowledged the challenges faced during the development process, noting that despite occasional heated exchanges and differing opinions, the final result aligned with the project&#8217;s initial objectives.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a starting point for a continued effort to engage with the communities to improve the definition over time,&#8221; he stated.</p>



<p>The OSAID does not require a specific legal mechanism for assuring that model parameters are freely available to all, though it may involve licences or legal instruments. This aspect is expected to become clearer over time as <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/eu-ai-act-early-prep-could-give-businesses-competitive-edge/">the legal system</a> addresses these open-source AI systems.</p>
