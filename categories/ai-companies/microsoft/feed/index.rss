										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2024, Big Tech is all-in on artificial intelligence, with companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta leading the way.</p>



<p>Their combined spending on AI is projected to exceed a jaw-dropping $240 billion. Why? Because AI isn’t just the future—it’s the present, and the demand for AI-powered tools and infrastructure has never been higher. The companies aren’t just keeping up; they’re setting the pace for the industry.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://dataconomy.com/2024/11/18/big-tech-ai-spending-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scale of their investment</a> is hard to ignore. In the first half of 2023, tech giants poured $74 billion into capital expenditure. By Q3, that number had jumped to $109 billion. In mid-2024, spending reached $104 billion, a remarkable 47% rise over the same period a year earlier. By Q3, the total hit $171 billion.</p>



<p>If this pattern continues, Q4 might add another $70 billion, bringing the total to a truly staggering $240 billion for the year.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why so much spending?</h3>



<p>AI’s potential is immense, and companies are making sure they’re positioned to reap the rewards.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A growing market: AI is projected to create $20 trillion in global economic impact by 2030. In countries like India, AI could contribute $500 billion to GDP by 2025. With stakes this high, big tech isn’t hesitating to invest heavily.</li>



<li>Infrastructure demands: Training and running AI models require massive investment in infrastructure, from data centres to high-performance GPUs. Alphabet increased its capital expenditures by 62% last quarter compared to the previous year, even as it cut its workforce by 9,000 employees to manage costs.</li>



<li>Revenue potential: AI is already proving its value. Microsoft’s AI products are expected to generate $10 billion annually—the fastest-growing segment in the company’s history. Alphabet, meanwhile, uses AI to write over 25% of its new code, streamlining operations.</li>
</ul>



<p>Amazon is also ramping up, with plans to spend $75 billion on capital expenditure in 2024. Meta’s forecast is not far behind, with estimates between $38 and $40 billion. Across the board, organisations recognise that maintaining their edge in AI requires sustained and significant investment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Supporting revenue streams</h3>



<p>What keeps the massive investments keep on coming is the strength of big tech’s core businesses. Last quarter, Alphabet’s digital advertising machine, which is powered by Google’s search engine, generated $49.39 billion in ad revenue, a 12% year-over-year increase. This as a solid foundation that allows Alphabet to pour resources into building out its AI arsenal without destabilising the bottom line.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s diversified revenue streams are another example. While the company spent $20 billion on AI and cloud infrastructure last quarter, its productivity segment, which includes Office, grew by 12% to $28.3 billion, and its personal computing business, boosted by <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/11/18/0022217/google-microsoft-are-spending-massively-on-ai-quarterly-earnings-show" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox and the Activision Blizzard acquisition</a>, grew 17% to $13.2 billion. These successes demonstrate how AI investments can support broader growth strategies.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The financial payoff</h3>



<p>Big tech is already seeing the benefits of its heavy spending. Microsoft’s Azure platform has seen substantial growth, with its AI income approaching $6 billion. Amazon’s AI business is growing at triple-digit rates, and Alphabet reported a 34% jump in profits last quarter, with cloud revenue playing a major role.</p>



<p>Meta, while primarily focused on advertising, is leveraging AI to make its platforms more engaging. AI-driven tools, such as improved feeds and search features keep users on its platforms longer, resulting in new revenue growth.</p>



<p>AI spending shows no signs of slowing down. Tech leaders at Microsoft and Alphabet view AI as a long-term investment critical to their future success. And the results speak for themselves: Alphabet’s cloud revenue is up 35%, while Microsoft’s cloud business grew 20% last quarter.</p>



<p>For the time being, the focus is on scaling up infrastructure and meeting demand. However, the real transformation will come when big tech unlocks AI’s full potential, transforming industries and redefining how we work and live.</p>



<p>By investing in high-quality, centralised data strategies, businesses can ensure trustworthy and accurate AI implementations, and unlock AI’s full potential to drive innovation, improve decision-making, and gain competitive edge. AI’s revolutionary promise is within reach—but only for companies prepared to lay the groundwork for sustainable growth and long-term results.</p>

<p>Microsoft Edge has evolved into more than simply a browser; it is a critical component of Microsoft’s ecosystem, meant to integrate smoothly with Windows and highlight the company’s latest innovations, such as its AI assistant, Copilot. </p>



<p>While these interconnections make Edge a viable choice, Microsoft’s methods for persuading consumers to choose it have been far from covert.</p>



<p>From default settings that prioritise Edge to persistent prompts at startup, Microsoft has made it clear they want Edge to be the go-to for Windows users. And lately, it&#8217;s upped the ante: now, Edge can launch automatically when your computer boots up, instantly nudging you to bring over your data from other browsers.</p>



<p>The most recent update includes an auto-checked option to import browsing data from Chrome, such as history, bookmarks, and open tabs, in the name of users leveraging the features of AI assistant, Copilot. Although AI features may be appealing to some, the aggressive approach has left many users feeling annoyed rather than tempted.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294454/microsoft-edge-chrome-tabs-prompt-trick">The Verge</a></em> recently noticed that when you start up your PC, Edge might decide to open on its own, promptly displaying a pop-up for its AI assistant, Copilot. Right next to Copilot, there’s a conveniently checked box allowing Edge to import data from other browsers automatically. For some users, this seems like an overreach, raising doubts about how far Microsoft is ready to go to make Edge the browser of choice.</p>



<p>Microsoft has confirmed this setup and stated that customers have the option to opt-out. Still, with default settings that favour data imports and an eye-catching import button, it’s easy for users to unintentionally make the switch, especially if they’re not paying attention. For those who prefer sticking with their existing browsers without interruption, the approach can feel unwelcome.</p>



<p>But even if users dodge the pop-ups, Edge isn’t exactly shy. Uninstalling it is a complex process, and it often gets reinstalled by Windows updates, much to the frustration of users who would rather go without. For many, this persistence feels more like a forceful sales pitch rather than a friendly suggestion.</p>



<p>Interestingly, this isn’t the first time Microsoft has tried this type of strategy. A similar message appeared to users earlier this year but was pulled back after strong objections. Now, it’s back, with Microsoft’s Caitlin Roulston stating the notification is meant to “give users the choice to import data from other browsers.”</p>



<p>In fact, Microsoft’s bold tactics go back some years. In 2022, it introduced a feature that could automatically pull data from Chrome into Edge – although users had the option to decline. In 2021, the company made it practically impossible to set any browser other than Edge as the default, resulting in enough outcry for Microsoft to back down.</p>



<p>While Microsoft promotes its intrusive pop-ups as a way to give users more control, others who value choice without constant nudges. The relentless push for Edge usage could actually be detrimental, as the company&#8217;s persistence may drive users toward other browsers rather than away. To truly compete, Microsoft might benefit from letting Edge’s strengths speak for themselves rather than relying on aggressive prompts to change hearts and minds.</p>

<p>A comprehensive AI sector study – conducted by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-science-innovation-and-technology">Department for Science, Innovation and Technology</a> (DSIT) in collaboration with <a href="https://perspectiveeconomics.com/">Perspective Economics</a>, <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/">Ipsos</a>, and <a href="http://glass.ai">glass.ai</a> – provides a detailed overview of the industry&#8217;s current state and its future prospects.</p>



<p>In this article, we delve deeper into the key findings and implications—drawing on additional sources to enhance our understanding.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Thriving industry with significant growth</h3>



<p>The study highlights the remarkable growth of the UK&#8217;s AI sector. With over 3,170 active AI companies, these firms have generated £10.6 billion in AI-related revenues and <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/the-uk-outpacing-the-us-for-ai-hiring/">employed</a> more than 50,000 people in AI-related roles. This significant contribution to GVA (Gross Value Added) underscores the sector&#8217;s <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/ai-could-unleash-119-billion-in-uk-productivity/">transformative potential</a> in driving the UK&#8217;s economic growth.</p>



<p>Mark Boost, CEO of <a href="https://www.civo.com/">Civo</a>, said: &#8220;In a space that&#8217;s been dominated by US companies for too long, it&#8217;s promising to see the government now stepping up to help support the UK AI sector on the global stage.&#8221;</p>



<p>The study shows that AI activity is dispersed across various regions of the UK, with notable concentrations in London, the South East, and Scotland. This regional dispersion indicates a broad scope for the development of AI technology applications across different sectors and regions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Investment and funding</h3>



<p>Investment in the AI sector has been a key driver of growth. In 2022, £18.8 billion was secured in private investment since 2016, with investments made in 52 unique industry sectors compared to 35 sectors in 2016.</p>



<p>The government&#8217;s commitment to supporting AI is evident through significant investments. In 2022, the UK government unveiled a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy">National AI Strategy</a> and Action Plan—committing over £1.3 billion in support for the sector, complementing the £2.8 billion already invested.</p>



<p>However, as Boost cautions, &#8220;Major players like <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/aws-nvidia-expand-partnership-advance-generative-ai/">AWS</a> are locking AI startups into their ecosystems with offerings like $500k cloud credits, ensuring that emerging companies start their journey reliant on their infrastructure. This not only hinders competition and promotes vendor lock-in but also risks stifling innovation across the broader UK AI ecosystem.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Addressing bottlenecks</h3>



<p>Despite the growth and investment, several bottlenecks must be addressed to fully harness the potential of AI:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> The UK&#8217;s digital technology infrastructure is less advanced than many other countries. This bottleneck includes inadequate <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/uk-secures-6-3b-data-infrastructure-investments/">data centre infrastructure</a> and a dependent supply of powerful GPU computer chips. Boost emphasises this concern, stating &#8220;It would be dangerous for the government to ignore the immense compute power that AI relies on. We need to consider where this power is coming from and the impact it&#8217;s having on both the already over-concentrated <a href="https://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/">cloud market</a> and the environment.&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Commercial awareness:</strong> Many SMEs lack familiarity with digital technology. Almost a third (31%) of SMEs have yet to adopt the cloud, and nearly half (47%) do not currently use AI tools or applications.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Skills shortage:</strong> Two-fifths of businesses <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/93-of-firms-committed-to-ai-but-skills-shortage-posing-problems/">struggle to find staff</a> with good digital skills, including traditional digital roles like data analytics or IT. There is a rising need for workers with new AI-specific skills, such as prompt engineering, that will require retraining and upskilling opportunities.</li>
</ul>



<p>To address these bottlenecks, the government has implemented several initiatives:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Private sector investment:</strong> <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/categories/ai-companies/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> has announced a £2.5 billion investment in AI skills, security, and data centre infrastructure, aiming to procure more than 20,000 of the most advanced GPUs by 2026.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Government support:</strong> The government has invested £1.5 billion in <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/uk-and-canada-sign-ai-compute-agreement/">computing capacity</a> and committed to building three new supercomputers by 2025. This support aims to enhance the UK&#8217;s infrastructure to stay competitive in the AI market.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Public sector integration:</strong> The UK Government Digital Service (GDS) is working to improve efficiency using predictive algorithms for future pension scheme behaviour. HMRC uses AI to help identify call centre priorities, demonstrating how AI solutions can address complex public sector challenges.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Future prospects and challenges</h3>



<p>The future of the UK AI sector is both promising and challenging. While significant economic gains are predicted, including boosting GDP by £550 billion by 2035, delays in AI roll-out could cost the UK £150 billion over the same period. Ensuring a balanced approach between innovation and <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/solarwinds-it-professionals-stronger-ai-regulation/">regulation</a> will be crucial.</p>



<p>Boost emphasises the importance of data sovereignty and <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/categories/privacy/">privacy</a>: &#8220;Businesses have grown increasingly wary of how their data is collected, stored, and used by the likes of ChatGPT. The government has a real opportunity to enable the UK AI sector to offer viable alternatives.</p>



<p>“The forthcoming AI Action Plan will be another opportunity to identify how AI can drive economic growth and better support the UK tech sector.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the near future, Silicon Valley might look back at recent events as the point where the generative AI craze went too far.</p>



<p>This past summer, investors questioned whether top AI stocks could sustain their sky-high valuations, given the lack of returns on massive AI spending. As Autumn approaches, major AI sectors—such as chips, LLMs, and AI devices—received renewed confidence. Nonetheless, there are an increasing number of reasons to be cautious.</p>



<p><strong>Cerebras: A chip contender with a major risk</strong></p>



<p>Chip startup Cerebras is challenging Nvidia&#8217;s dominance by developing processors designed to power smarter LLMs. <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/nvidia-share-price-nosedives-antitrust-clouds-gather/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nvidia</a>, a major player in the AI boom, has seen its market cap skyrocket from $364 billion at the start of 2023 to over $3 trillion.</p>



<p>Cerebras, however, relies heavily on a single customer: the Abu Dhabi-based AI firm G42. In 2023, G42 accounted for 83% of Cerebras&#8217; revenue, and in the first half of 2024, that figure increased to 87%. While G42 is backed by major players like Microsoft and Silver Lake, its dependency poses a risk. Even though Cerebras has signed a deal with Saudi Aramco, its reliance on one client may cause concerns as it seeks a $7-8 billion valuation for its IPO.</p>



<p><strong>OpenAI&#8217;s record-breaking funding – but with strings attached</strong></p>



<p>OpenAI made the news when it raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion valuation, becoming the largest investment round in Silicon Valley history. However, the company has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/66e0653e-c446-47b2-8a7f-baa54ccbfb9a?accessToken=zwAAAZJOTf4Kkc9m4GU-xEZHstOKf7qlTMv7mg.MEUCIEJBi-VbRpNb9MIo2y24cDg8XwZ1lH2wIV_Kc-UGHtCBAiEA8JUYYonEqynzl_Wyz-3pPnT4q23D5MCTtg0M0CZ25ak&amp;segmentId=e95a9ae7-622c-6235-5f87-51e412b47e97&amp;shareType=enterprise&amp;shareId=b484077e-9f3e-4aef-a08b-93a56609306a" rel="noreferrer noopener">urged its investors</a> not to back competitors such as Anthropic and Elon Musk&#8217;s xAI—an unusual request in the world of venture capital, where spread betting is common. Critics, including Gary Marcus, have described this approach as &#8220;running scared.&#8221;</p>



<p>OpenAI&#8217;s backers also include &#8220;bubble chasers&#8221; such as SoftBank and Tiger Global, firms known for investing in companies at their peak, which frequently results in huge losses. With top executives such as CTO Mira Murati departing and predicted losses of $5 billion this year despite rising revenues, OpenAI faces significant challenges.</p>



<p><strong>Meta&#8217;s big bet on AI wearables</strong></p>



<p>Meta entered the AI race by unveiling Orion, its augmented reality glasses. The wearables promise to integrate AI into daily life, with Nvidia&#8217;s CEO Jensen Huang endorsing the product. However, at a production cost of $10,000 per unit, the price is a major obstacle.</p>



<p>Meta will need to reduce costs and overcome consumer hesitation, as previous attempts at AI-powered wearables—such as Snapchat&#8217;s glasses,  Google Glass, and the Humane AI pin—have struggled to gain traction.</p>



<p><strong>The road ahead</strong></p>



<p>What&#8217;s next for AI? OpenAI must prove it can justify a $157 billion valuation while operating at a loss. Cerebras needs to reassure investors that relying on one client isn&#8217;t a dealbreaker. And Meta must convince consumers to adopt a completely new way of interacting with AI.</p>



<p>If these companies succeed, this moment could mark a turning point in the AI revolution. However, as tech history shows, high-stakes markets are rarely easy to win.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chinese internet search provider Baidu has <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3275717/baidu-blocks-google-bing-scraping-content-amid-demand-data-used-ai-projects?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=section" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated its Wikipedia-like Baike service</a> to prevent Google and Microsoft Bing from scraping its content.</p>



<p>This change was observed in the latest update to the Baidu Baike robots.txt file, which denies access to Googlebot and Bingbot crawlers.</p>



<p>According to the Wayback Machine, the change took place on August 8. Previously, Google and Bing search engines were allowed to index Baidu Baike&#8217;s central repository, which includes almost 30 million entries, although some target subdomains on the website were restricted.</p>



<p>This action by Baidu comes amid increasing demand for large datasets used in training artificial intelligence models and applications. It follows similar moves by other companies to protect their online content. In July, Reddit blocked various search engines, except Google, from indexing its posts and discussions. Google, <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/openai-secures-key-partnership-with-reddit/">like Reddit</a>, has a financial agreement with Reddit for data access to train its AI services.</p>



<p>According to sources, in the past year, Microsoft considered restricting access to internet-search data for rival search engine operators; this was most relevant for those who used the data for chatbots and generative AI services.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Chinese Wikipedia, with its 1.43 million entries, remains available to search engine crawlers. A survey conducted by the South China Morning Post found that entries from Baidu Baike still appear on both Bing and Google searches. Perhaps the search engines continue to use older cached content.</p>



<p>Such a move is emerging against the background where developers of generative AI around the world are increasingly working with content publishers in a bid to access the highest-quality content for their projects. For instance, relatively recently, OpenAI signed an agreement with Time magazine to access the entire archive, dating back to the very first day of the magazine&#8217;s publication over a century ago. A similar partnership was <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/ft-and-openai-ink-partnership-web-scraping-criticism/">inked</a> with the Financial Times in April.</p>



<p>Baidu&#8217;s decision to restrict access to its Baidu Baike content for major search engines highlights the growing importance of data in the AI era. As companies invest heavily in AI development, the value of large, curated datasets has significantly increased. This has led to a shift in how online platforms manage access to their content, with many choosing to limit or monetise access to their data.</p>



<p>As the AI industry continues to evolve, it&#8217;s likely that more companies will reassess their data-sharing policies, potentially leading to further changes in how information is indexed and accessed across the internet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to Carine Smith Ihenacho, chief governance and compliance officer of Norway&#8217;s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund, boards <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/companies-need-more-ai-competency-board-level-norways-wealth-fund-says-2024-08-16/">need to be proficient</a> with the use of AI and take control of its application in businesses to mitigate risks.</p>



<p>The Norges Bank Investment Fund, which holds considerable shares in almost 9,000 companies worldwide — accounting for 1.5% of all listed stocks — has become a trailblazer in environmental, social, and corporate governance issues. About a year ago, the fund also provided its invested companies with recommendations on integrating responsible AI to improve economic outcomes.</p>



<p>Several companies still have a lot of ground to cover. Specifically, when stating that &#8220;Overall, a lot of competence building needs to be done at the board level,&#8221; Smith Ihenacho clarified that this does not mean every board should have an AI specialist. Instead, boards need to collectively understand how AI matters in their business and have policies in place.</p>



<p>&#8220;They should know: &#8216;What&#8217;s our policy on AI? Are we high risk or low risk? Where does AI meet customers? Are we transparent around it?&#8217; It&#8217;s a big-picture question they should be able to answer,&#8221; Smith Ihenacho added, highlighting the breadth of understanding required at the board level.</p>



<p>The fund has shared its perspective on AI with the boards of its 60 largest portfolio companies, as reported in its 2023 responsible investment report. It is particularly focused on AI use in the healthcare sector due to its substantial impact on consumers, and is closely monitoring Big Tech companies that develop AI-based products.</p>



<p>In its engagement with tech firms, the fund emphasises the importance of robust governance structures to manage AI-related risks. &#8220;We focus more on the governance structure,&#8221; Smith Ihenacho explained. &#8220;Is the board involved? Do you have a proper policy on AI?&#8221;</p>



<p>The fund&#8217;s emphasis on AI governance is particularly relevant, given that nine of the ten largest positions in its equity holdings are tech companies. Leading among them are names such as Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta Platforms. Investments in these companies contributed to a 12.5% growth in the fund&#8217;s stock portfolio in the first half of 2024. The overall exposure to the tech sector increased from 21% to 26% over the past year, now comprising a quarter of the stock portfolio. This underscores the significant role that technology and AI play in the world today.</p>



<p>Though the fund favours AI innovation for its potential to boost efficiency and productivity, Smith Ihenacho has emphasised the importance of responsible use. She is quoted as saying, &#8220;It is fantastic what AI may be able to do to support innovation, efficiency, and productivity&#8230; we support that.&#8221; However, she also stressed the need to be responsible in how we manage the risks.</p>



<p>The fund&#8217;s adoption of AI governance aligns with rising global concerns about the ethical implications and potential dangers of these technologies. AI is increasingly utilised across various sectors, from finance to healthcare, and the need for governance frameworks has never been greater. The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund maintains a standard that requires companies to develop comprehensive AI policies at the board level, fostering the adoption of responsible AI practices across its large portfolio.</p>



<p>This initiative by one of the world&#8217;s largest investors could have far-reaching implications for corporate governance practices globally. As companies seek to harness the power of AI while navigating its complexities, the guidance provided by influential investors like Norges Bank Investment Fund may serve as a blueprint for responsible AI implementation and governance in the corporate world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.palantir.com/">Palantir</a>, a data analytics company known for its work in the defence and intelligence sectors, has announced a significant partnership with <a href="https://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>. The collaboration aims to deliver advanced services for classified networks utilised by US defence and intelligence agencies.</p>



<p>According to the recent announcement, Palantir is integrating Microsoft&#8217;s cutting-edge large language models via the Azure OpenAI Service into its AI platforms. The integration will occur within Microsoft&#8217;s government and classified cloud environments. As this collaboration is the first of its kind, this specific configuration has the potential to completely transform the use of AI in critical national security missions.</p>



<p>Palantir, whose name draws inspiration from the potentially misleading &#8220;seeing-stones&#8221; in J.R.R. Tolkien&#8217;s fictional works, specialises in processing and analysing vast quantities of data to assist governments and corporations with surveillance and decision-making tasks. While the precise nature of the services to be offered through this partnership remains somewhat ambiguous, it is clear that Palantir&#8217;s products will be integrated into Microsoft&#8217;s Azure cloud services. This development follows Azure&#8217;s previous incorporation of OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-4 technology into a &#8220;top secret&#8221; version of its software.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s journey is notable. Co-founded by Peter Thiel and initially funded by In-Q-Tel, the CIA&#8217;s venture capital arm, Palantir has grown to serve a diverse clientele. Its roster includes government agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and various police departments, as well as private sector giants like the pharmaceutical company Sanofi. Palantir has also become deeply involved in supporting Ukraine&#8217;s war efforts, with reports suggesting its software may be utilised in targeting decisions for military operations.</p>



<p>Even though Palantir has operated with a large customer base for years, it only reached its first annual profit in 2023. However, with the current surge of interest in AI, the company has been able to grow rapidly, particularly in the commercial sector. According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-05/palantir-reports-first-profitable-year-citing-big-ai-demand?sref=M8H6LjUF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, Palantir&#8217;s CEO, Alex Karp, warned that Palantir&#8217;s &#8220;commercial business is exploding in a way we don&#8217;t know how to handle.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite the urgency of this mission, the company&#8217;s annual filing clearly states that it neither does business with nor on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, nor does it plan to do so. This indicates that Palantir is especially careful in developing its customer base, considering the geopolitical implications of its work.</p>



<p>The announcement of this partnership has been well-received by investors, with Palantir&#8217;s share price surging more than 75 per cent in 2024 as of the time of writing. This dramatic increase reflects the market&#8217;s optimism about the potential of AI in national security applications and Palantir&#8217;s position at the forefront of this field.</p>



<p>Still, the partnership between Palantir and Microsoft raises significant questions about the role of AI in national security and surveillance. This is no surprise, as these are particularly sensitive areas, and the development of new technologies could potentially transform the sector forever.</p>



<p>More discussions and investigations are needed to understand the ethical implications of implementing these innovative tools. All things considered, the Palantir and Microsoft partnership is a significant event that will likely shape the future use of AI technologies and cloud computing in areas such as intelligence and defence.</p>

<p><a href="https://paige.ai/">Paige</a> and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230907172627/en/Paige-Announces-Collaboration-with-Microsoft-to-Build-the-World%E2%80%99s-Largest-Image-Based-AI-Model-to-Fight-Cancer">Microsoft</a> have unveiled the next big breakthrough in clinical AI for cancer diagnosis and treatment: Virchow2 and Virchow2G, enhanced versions of its revolutionary AI models for cancer pathology.</p>



<p>The Virchow2 and Virchow2G models are based on an enormous dataset that Paige has accumulated. Paige has gathered more than three million pathology slides from over 800 labs across 45 countries, on which the models were trained. Such a volume of data is, unsurprisingly, highly beneficial. This data was obtained from over 225,000 patients, all de-identified to create a rich and representative dataset encompassing all genders, races, ethnic groups, and regions across the globe.</p>



<p>What makes these models truly remarkable is their scope. They cover over 40 different tissue types and various staining methods, making them applicable to a wide range of cancer diagnoses. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virchow2G</a>, with its 1.8 billion parameters, stands as the largest pathology model ever created and sets new standards in AI training, scale, and performance.</p>



<p>As Dr. Thomas Fuchs, founder and chief scientist of Paige, comments: &#8220;We&#8217;re just beginning to tap into what these foundation models can achieve in revolutionising our understanding of cancer through computational pathology.&#8221; He believes these models will significantly improve the future for pathologists, and he agrees that this technology is becoming an important step in the progression of diagnostics, targeted medications, and customised patient care.</p>



<p>Similarly, Razik Yousfi, Paige&#8217;s senior vice president of technology, states that these models are not only making precision medicine a reality but are also improving the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, and pushing the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible in pathology and patient care.</p>



<p>So, how is this relevant to cancer diagnosis today? Paige has developed a clinical AI application that pathologists can use to recognise cancer in over 40 tissue types. This tool allows potentially hazardous areas to be identified more quickly and accurately. In other words, the diagnostic process becomes more efficient and less prone to errors, even for rare cancers, with the help of this tool.</p>



<p>Beyond diagnosis, Paige has created AI modules that can benefit life sciences and pharmaceutical companies. These tools can aid in therapeutic targeting, biomarker identification, and clinical trial design, potentially leading to more successful trials and faster development of new therapies.</p>



<p>The good news for researchers is that Virchow2 is available on Hugging Face for non-commercial research, while the entire suite of AI modules is now available for commercial use. This accessibility could accelerate advancements in cancer research and treatment across the scientific community.</p>



<p>In summary, the recently introduced AI models represent a major advancement in the fight against cancer. Paige and Microsoft have chosen the right path by combining the power of data with state-of-the-art AI technologies. These companies have created new opportunities for more accurate cancer prediction, paving the way for tailored solutions and innovative research in oncology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Elon Musk&#8217;s revived lawsuit against <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> includes fresh allegations against the company and two of its founders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman. This new legal salvo comes after Musk <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/musk-ends-openai-lawsuit-slamming-apple-chatgpt-plans/">withdrew a previous lawsuit</a> in June.</p>



<p>The earlier suit had primarily focused on claims that OpenAI had breached its founding agreement to keep the company&#8217;s technology open source. The fresh complaint, however, takes a more aggressive stance.</p>



<p>Musk&#8217;s legal team alleges that Altman and Brockman &#8220;assiduously manipulated Musk into co-founding their spurious non-profit venture&#8221; by making promises about OpenAI&#8217;s safety and transparency that set it apart from profit-driven alternatives. The lawsuit goes so far as to claim that assurances about OpenAI&#8217;s nonprofit structure were &#8220;the hook for Altman&#8217;s long con.&#8221;</p>



<p>Marc Toberoff, Musk&#8217;s lawyer, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/elon-musk-openai-lawsuit.html">The New York Times</a>, &#8220;This is a much more forceful lawsuit.&#8221; Indeed, the new suit ups the ante by accusing OpenAI of breaching federal racketeering laws in what it describes as a conspiracy to defraud Musk.</p>



<p>The complaint paints a picture of extensive deception, alleging that Altman and OpenAI lured Musk into co-founding the organisation under false pretences of AI safety and openness. Musk claims he invested significant resources and recruited top scientists based on these assurances, only to see the company pivot towards a profit-making model that compromised its original mission.</p>



<p>The lawsuit details allegations of self-dealing and conflicts of interest by Altman, which Musk argues led to their falling out and ultimately compromised OpenAI&#8217;s founding principles. Reports of withheld technology and a compromised Board of Directors have raised serious ethical concerns about the company&#8217;s operations and future direction.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the lawsuit takes aim at OpenAI&#8217;s partnership with Microsoft. It claims that the contract between the two tech giants includes a clause that would revoke Microsoft&#8217;s rights to OpenAI&#8217;s technology once artificial general intelligence (AGI) is achieved. This allegation, if proven true, could have far-reaching implications for the future of AI development and corporate partnerships in the tech industry.</p>



<p>The legal action seeks not only damages and restitution but also punitive measures against the defendants for allegedly exploiting Musk&#8217;s contributions. The tech billionaire is pushing for Altman to be divested of what the lawsuit describes as &#8220;ill-gotten gains&#8221; resulting from the alleged deception.</p>



<p>Musk&#8217;s complaint goes beyond mere contractual disputes, invoking serious legal charges including fraud, breach of contract, wire fraud, and violations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act">RICO</a> (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) law against Altman, Brockman, and OpenAI.</p>



<p>The revival of Musk&#8217;s legal battle against OpenAI comes at a time of increasing scrutiny of AI technologies and their potential impact on society. As one of the original co-founders of OpenAI, Musk&#8217;s allegations carry significant weight and could potentially reshape the narrative around the company&#8217;s evolution from a non-profit to a for-profit entity.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s worth noting that OpenAI has consistently maintained that its transition to a &#8220;capped-profit&#8221; model was necessary to secure the funding required for its ambitious AI research and development goals. The company has also emphasised its commitment to developing AI in a responsible and beneficial manner.</p>



<p>The tech community and legal experts will be watching closely as this case progresses, given its potential to set precedents for how AI companies <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/balancing-innovation-trust-experts-assess-eu-ai-act/">are held accountable</a> to their stated missions and founding principles.</p>

<p>As AI takes centre stage in Silicon Valley, an inconvenient truth is emerging behind the scenes: AI has a massive carbon footprint. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Amazon have made bold commitments to slash greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years, but the technology they&#8217;re betting their futures on is making those climate goals increasingly challenging to achieve.</p>



<p>Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/05/15/microsoft-environmental-sustainability-report-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that its carbon emissions had surged nearly 30% since 2020, mainly due to the construction and operation of energy-hungry data centres needed to power its AI ambitions. Google <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/google-dilemma-ai-expansion-vs-achieving-climate-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> an even steeper 48% rise in emissions compared to 2019. These trends highlight the growing tension between rapid AI development and environmental sustainability in the tech sector.</p>



<p>The root of the problem lies in AI&#8217;s immense appetite for computing power and electricity. Training large language models like GPT-3 requires vast amounts of data to be processed by thousands of specialized chips running around the clock in sprawling data centres. Once deployed, AI models consume significant energy with each query or task.</p>



<p>&#8220;One query to ChatGPT uses approximately as much electricity as could light one light bulb for about 20 minutes,&#8221; explained Jesse Dodge, a researcher at the Allen Institute for AI, in&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/12/g-s1-9545/ai-brings-soaring-emissions-for-google-and-microsoft-a-major-contributor-to-climate-change" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<em>NPR</em>. &#8220;So, you can imagine that millions of people using something like that every day adds up to a really large amount of electricity.&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed, according to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/AI-poised-to-drive-160-increase-in-power-demand" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goldman Sachs analysts</a>, a typical ChatGPT query requires nearly ten times as much electricity as a standard Google search. As AI capabilities expand and usage skyrockets, so too does its energy demand. Goldman Sachs estimates that data centres will consume 8% of global electricity by 2030, up from about 3% today—a massive jump primarily driven by AI.</p>



<p>The tech industry&#8217;s intense electricity consumption impacts regional power grids and even influences decisions around fossil fuel use. Data centre operators in Northern Virginia are expected to require enough electricity to power 6 million homes by 2030. In some areas, plans to decommission coal plants have been delayed to meet surging power needs.</p>



<p>This puts tech giants in a difficult position as they try to balance their AI ambitions with climate commitments. Microsoft has pledged to become carbon-negative by 2030, removing more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits. That goal now appears increasingly challenging. The latest sustainability report acknowledges that &#8220;as we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands.&#8221;</p>



<p>Google had long touted its carbon-neutral status, achieved through carbon offsets. But in 2023, it admitted it was no longer &#8220;maintaining operational carbon neutrality&#8221; due to emissions growth. The company still aims for net-zero emissions by 2030 but called that timeline &#8220;fraught with challenges.&#8221;</p>



<p>Other major players in AI development, like OpenAI, have yet to disclose any emissions data, leaving the full scope of the industry&#8217;s climate impact unclear. However, Microsoft and Google&#8217;s trends paint a concerning picture.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have an existential crisis right now. It&#8217;s called climate change, and AI is palpably making it worse,&#8221; warned Alex Hanna, director of research at the Distributed AI Research Institute, in an interview with&nbsp;<em>NPR</em>.</p>



<p>To their credit, tech companies are not ignoring the problem. They&#8217;re investing heavily in renewable energy, exploring more efficient chip designs, and researching ways to reduce AI&#8217;s energy needs. Microsoft says it has expanded the use of low-power server states to cut energy use by up to 25% on some machines. Google is designing data centres that it claims will use zero water for cooling.</p>



<p>However, these efforts are being outpaced by the breakneck speed of AI development and deployment. Every major tech firm is racing to integrate AI across their product lines, from search engines to productivity software to social media. The potential economic and competitive advantages are simply too large to ignore.</p>



<p>This leaves the tech industry at a crossroads. Companies must find ways to dramatically improve AI&#8217;s energy efficiency or risk undermining their climate goals and facing growing criticism over their environmental impact. Regulators and the public may also need to grapple with difficult questions about the societal value of AI applications versus their climate costs.</p>



<p>The coming years will be crucial in determining whether artificial intelligence becomes a powerful tool for addressing climate change or accelerates the very problem it could help solve. For now, as Microsoft&#8217;s president Brad Smith told&nbsp;<em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-15/microsoft-s-ai-investment-imperils-climate-goal-as-emissions-jump-30?sref=QqWIvTvt" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, the company believes &#8220;the answer is not to slow down the expansion of AI but to speed up the work needed to make it more environmentally friendly.&#8221; Time will tell if that optimism is warranted or if more drastic measures will be needed to reconcile AI&#8217;s promise with its environmental price tag.</p>
