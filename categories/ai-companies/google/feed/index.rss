										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai has announced the launch of Gemini 2.0, a model that represents the next step in Google’s ambition to revolutionise AI.</p>



<p>A year after introducing the Gemini 1.0 model, this major upgrade incorporates enhanced multimodal capabilities, agentic functionality, and innovative user tools designed to push boundaries in AI-driven technology.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Leap towards transformational AI&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Reflecting on Google’s 26-year mission to organise and make the world’s information accessible, Pichai remarked, “If Gemini 1.0 was about organising and understanding information, Gemini 2.0 is about making it much more useful.”</p>



<p>Gemini 1.0, released in December 2022, was notable for being Google’s first natively multimodal AI model. The first iteration excelled at understanding and processing text, video, images, audio, and code. Its enhanced 1.5 version became widely embraced by developers for its long-context understanding, enabling applications such as the productivity-focused NotebookLM.</p>



<p>Now, with Gemini 2.0, Google aims to accelerate the role of AI as a universal assistant capable of native image and audio generation, better reasoning and planning, and real-world decision-making capabilities. In Pichai&#8217;s words, the development represents the dawn of an “agentic era.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Introducing Gemini 2.0 | Our most capable AI model yet" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fs0t6SdODd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>“We have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision,” Pichai explained.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gemini 2.0: Core features and availability</h3>



<p>At the heart of today&#8217;s announcement is the experimental release of Gemini 2.0 Flash, the flagship model of Gemini’s second generation. It builds upon the foundations laid by its predecessors while delivering faster response times and advanced performance.</p>



<p>Gemini 2.0 Flash supports multimodal inputs and outputs, including the ability to generate native images in conjunction with text and produce steerable text-to-speech multilingual audio. Additionally, users can benefit from native tool integration such as Google Search and even third-party user-defined functions.</p>



<p>Developers and businesses will gain access to Gemini 2.0 Flash via the Gemini API in <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/">Google AI Studio</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai">Vertex AI</a>, while larger model sizes are scheduled for broader release in January 2024.</p>



<p>For global accessibility, the Gemini app now features a chat-optimised version of the 2.0 Flash experimental model. Early adopters can experience this updated assistant on desktop and mobile, with a mobile app rollout imminent.</p>



<p>Products such as Google Search are also being enhanced with Gemini 2.0, unlocking the ability to handle complex queries like advanced math problems, coding enquiries, and multimodal questions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Comprehensive suite of AI innovations&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The launch of Gemini 2.0 comes with compelling new tools that showcase its capabilities.</p>



<p>One such feature, Deep Research, functions as an AI research assistant, simplifying the process of investigating complex topics by compiling information into comprehensive reports. Another upgrade enhances Search with Gemini-enabled AI Overviews that tackle intricate, multi-step user queries.</p>



<p>The model was trained using Google’s sixth-generation Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), known as Trillium, which Pichai notes “powered 100% of Gemini 2.0 training and inference.”</p>



<p>Trillium is now <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/trillium-tpu-is-ga">available</a> for external developers, allowing them to benefit from the same infrastructure that supports Google’s own advancements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pioneering agentic experiences&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Accompanying Gemini 2.0 are experimental “agentic” prototypes built to explore the future of human-AI collaboration, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Project Astra: A universal AI assistant</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>First introduced at I/O earlier this year, Project Astra taps into Gemini 2.0’s multimodal understanding to improve real-world AI interactions. Trusted testers have trialled the assistant on Android, offering feedback that has helped refine its multilingual dialogue, memory retention, and integration with Google tools like Search, Lens, and Maps. Astra has also demonstrated near-human conversational latency, with further research underway for its application in wearable technology, such as prototype AI glasses.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Project Mariner: Redefining web automation </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Project Mariner is an experimental web-browsing assistant that uses Gemini 2.0’s ability to reason across text, images, and interactive elements like forms within a browser. In initial tests, it achieved an 83.5% success rate on the WebVoyager benchmark for completing end-to-end web tasks. Early testers using a Chrome extension are helping to refine Mariner’s capabilities while Google evaluates safety measures that ensure the technology remains user-friendly and secure.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Jules: A coding agent for developers  </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Jules, an AI-powered assistant built for developers, integrates directly into GitHub workflows to address coding challenges. It can autonomously propose solutions, generate plans, and execute code-based tasks—all under human supervision. This experimental endeavour is part of Google’s long-term goal to create versatile AI agents across various domains.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Gaming applications and beyond  </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Extending Gemini 2.0’s reach into virtual environments, Google DeepMind is working with gaming partners like Supercell on intelligent game agents. These experimental AI companions can interpret game actions in real-time, suggest strategies, and even access broader knowledge via Search. Research is also being conducted into how Gemini 2.0’s spatial reasoning could support robotics, opening doors for physical-world applications in the future.</p>

<iframe title="Project Astra | Exploring the future capabilities of a universal AI assistant" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hIIlJt8JERI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Addressing responsibility in AI development</h3>



<p>As AI capabilities expand, Google emphasises the importance of prioritising safety and ethical considerations.</p>



<p>Google claims Gemini 2.0 underwent extensive risk assessments, bolstered by the Responsibility and Safety Committee’s oversight to mitigate potential risks. Additionally, its embedded reasoning abilities allow for <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/openai-enhances-ai-safety-new-red-teaming-methods/">advanced “red-teaming,”</a> enabling developers to evaluate security scenarios and optimise safety measures at scale.</p>



<p>Google is also exploring safeguards to address user privacy, prevent misuse, and ensure AI agents remain reliable. For instance, Project Mariner is designed to prioritise user instructions while resisting malicious prompt injections, preventing threats like phishing or fraudulent transactions. Meanwhile, privacy controls in Project Astra make it easy for users to manage session data and deletion preferences.</p>



<p>Pichai reaffirmed the company’s commitment to responsible development, stating, “We firmly believe that the only way to build AI is to be responsible from the start.”</p>



<p>With the Gemini 2.0 Flash release, Google is edging closer to its vision of building a universal assistant capable of transforming interactions across domains.</p>

<p>In 2024, Big Tech is all-in on artificial intelligence, with companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta leading the way.</p>



<p>Their combined spending on AI is projected to exceed a jaw-dropping $240 billion. Why? Because AI isn’t just the future—it’s the present, and the demand for AI-powered tools and infrastructure has never been higher. The companies aren’t just keeping up; they’re setting the pace for the industry.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://dataconomy.com/2024/11/18/big-tech-ai-spending-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scale of their investment</a> is hard to ignore. In the first half of 2023, tech giants poured $74 billion into capital expenditure. By Q3, that number had jumped to $109 billion. In mid-2024, spending reached $104 billion, a remarkable 47% rise over the same period a year earlier. By Q3, the total hit $171 billion.</p>



<p>If this pattern continues, Q4 might add another $70 billion, bringing the total to a truly staggering $240 billion for the year.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why so much spending?</h3>



<p>AI’s potential is immense, and companies are making sure they’re positioned to reap the rewards.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A growing market: AI is projected to create $20 trillion in global economic impact by 2030. In countries like India, AI could contribute $500 billion to GDP by 2025. With stakes this high, big tech isn’t hesitating to invest heavily.</li>



<li>Infrastructure demands: Training and running AI models require massive investment in infrastructure, from data centres to high-performance GPUs. Alphabet increased its capital expenditures by 62% last quarter compared to the previous year, even as it cut its workforce by 9,000 employees to manage costs.</li>



<li>Revenue potential: AI is already proving its value. Microsoft’s AI products are expected to generate $10 billion annually—the fastest-growing segment in the company’s history. Alphabet, meanwhile, uses AI to write over 25% of its new code, streamlining operations.</li>
</ul>



<p>Amazon is also ramping up, with plans to spend $75 billion on capital expenditure in 2024. Meta’s forecast is not far behind, with estimates between $38 and $40 billion. Across the board, organisations recognise that maintaining their edge in AI requires sustained and significant investment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Supporting revenue streams</h3>



<p>What keeps the massive investments keep on coming is the strength of big tech’s core businesses. Last quarter, Alphabet’s digital advertising machine, which is powered by Google’s search engine, generated $49.39 billion in ad revenue, a 12% year-over-year increase. This as a solid foundation that allows Alphabet to pour resources into building out its AI arsenal without destabilising the bottom line.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s diversified revenue streams are another example. While the company spent $20 billion on AI and cloud infrastructure last quarter, its productivity segment, which includes Office, grew by 12% to $28.3 billion, and its personal computing business, boosted by <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/11/18/0022217/google-microsoft-are-spending-massively-on-ai-quarterly-earnings-show" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox and the Activision Blizzard acquisition</a>, grew 17% to $13.2 billion. These successes demonstrate how AI investments can support broader growth strategies.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The financial payoff</h3>



<p>Big tech is already seeing the benefits of its heavy spending. Microsoft’s Azure platform has seen substantial growth, with its AI income approaching $6 billion. Amazon’s AI business is growing at triple-digit rates, and Alphabet reported a 34% jump in profits last quarter, with cloud revenue playing a major role.</p>



<p>Meta, while primarily focused on advertising, is leveraging AI to make its platforms more engaging. AI-driven tools, such as improved feeds and search features keep users on its platforms longer, resulting in new revenue growth.</p>



<p>AI spending shows no signs of slowing down. Tech leaders at Microsoft and Alphabet view AI as a long-term investment critical to their future success. And the results speak for themselves: Alphabet’s cloud revenue is up 35%, while Microsoft’s cloud business grew 20% last quarter.</p>



<p>For the time being, the focus is on scaling up infrastructure and meeting demand. However, the real transformation will come when big tech unlocks AI’s full potential, transforming industries and redefining how we work and live.</p>



<p>By investing in high-quality, centralised data strategies, businesses can ensure trustworthy and accurate AI implementations, and unlock AI’s full potential to drive innovation, improve decision-making, and gain competitive edge. AI’s revolutionary promise is within reach—but only for companies prepared to lay the groundwork for sustainable growth and long-term results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Microsoft Edge has evolved into more than simply a browser; it is a critical component of Microsoft’s ecosystem, meant to integrate smoothly with Windows and highlight the company’s latest innovations, such as its AI assistant, Copilot. </p>



<p>While these interconnections make Edge a viable choice, Microsoft’s methods for persuading consumers to choose it have been far from covert.</p>



<p>From default settings that prioritise Edge to persistent prompts at startup, Microsoft has made it clear they want Edge to be the go-to for Windows users. And lately, it&#8217;s upped the ante: now, Edge can launch automatically when your computer boots up, instantly nudging you to bring over your data from other browsers.</p>



<p>The most recent update includes an auto-checked option to import browsing data from Chrome, such as history, bookmarks, and open tabs, in the name of users leveraging the features of AI assistant, Copilot. Although AI features may be appealing to some, the aggressive approach has left many users feeling annoyed rather than tempted.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294454/microsoft-edge-chrome-tabs-prompt-trick">The Verge</a></em> recently noticed that when you start up your PC, Edge might decide to open on its own, promptly displaying a pop-up for its AI assistant, Copilot. Right next to Copilot, there’s a conveniently checked box allowing Edge to import data from other browsers automatically. For some users, this seems like an overreach, raising doubts about how far Microsoft is ready to go to make Edge the browser of choice.</p>



<p>Microsoft has confirmed this setup and stated that customers have the option to opt-out. Still, with default settings that favour data imports and an eye-catching import button, it’s easy for users to unintentionally make the switch, especially if they’re not paying attention. For those who prefer sticking with their existing browsers without interruption, the approach can feel unwelcome.</p>



<p>But even if users dodge the pop-ups, Edge isn’t exactly shy. Uninstalling it is a complex process, and it often gets reinstalled by Windows updates, much to the frustration of users who would rather go without. For many, this persistence feels more like a forceful sales pitch rather than a friendly suggestion.</p>



<p>Interestingly, this isn’t the first time Microsoft has tried this type of strategy. A similar message appeared to users earlier this year but was pulled back after strong objections. Now, it’s back, with Microsoft’s Caitlin Roulston stating the notification is meant to “give users the choice to import data from other browsers.”</p>



<p>In fact, Microsoft’s bold tactics go back some years. In 2022, it introduced a feature that could automatically pull data from Chrome into Edge – although users had the option to decline. In 2021, the company made it practically impossible to set any browser other than Edge as the default, resulting in enough outcry for Microsoft to back down.</p>



<p>While Microsoft promotes its intrusive pop-ups as a way to give users more control, others who value choice without constant nudges. The relentless push for Edge usage could actually be detrimental, as the company&#8217;s persistence may drive users toward other browsers rather than away. To truly compete, Microsoft might benefit from letting Edge’s strengths speak for themselves rather than relying on aggressive prompts to change hearts and minds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Google has big hopes for AI, as evidenced by the consistent improvements to its Gemini chatbot in recent months.</p>



<p>Google briefly introduced its vision for a “universal AI agent” aimed to help users with daily tasks at the I/O developer conference in May, hinting that elements of the technology could be incorporated into Gemini soon. Recent insights from <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-preps-ai-that-takes-over-computers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Information</a></em> have shed more light on its initiative, known internally as <em>Project Jarvis</em>.</p>



<p>Project Jarvis represents a major advancement in AI for Google. Unlike traditional voice assistants that respond to user commands, Jarvis is designed to perform tasks autonomously, navigate the web, and make independent decisions. For instance, Jarvis could manage emails, conduct research, and even schedule appointments, reducing the cognitive load involved in managing digital tasks.</p>



<p>Jarvis’s core objective is to revolutionise how users interact with their devices. Rather than serving as a passive tool awaiting commands, Jarvis would actively engage in real-time task management, positioning it as an AI partner rather than a utility.</p>



<p>For legal professionals, Jarvis could review large volumes of case documents and organise them by relevance, streamlining workflow. Similarly, marketers could use Jarvis to integrate data from numerous sources, allowing them to focus more on strategy and less on administrative work.</p>



<p>The evolution of AI agents such as Jarvis may have an impact on specific job roles. Tasks formerly performed by entry-level administrative personnel may come within the capabilities of AI assistants. However, the shift is likely to generate opportunities in roles that require critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence—qualities not easily replicated by AI.</p>



<p>Industry observers anticipate a shift toward higher-value work, with people concentrating less on routine tasks and more on areas that promote innovation and strategic decision-making.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Privacy and security considerations</h2>



<p>Project Jarvis raises significant privacy and security issues due to its ability to access sensitive information such as emails and documents. To prevent unauthorised access, Google will most likely deploy enhanced encryption, strict user restrictions, and, maybe, multi-factor authentication. Cybersecurity will also be essential to keep Jarvis secure from external threats.</p>



<p>Surveys indicate that, while AI holds considerable appeal, privacy remains a top concern for many users. Experts recommend measures such as a transparent privacy dashboard that enables users to monitor and control Jarvis’s access to data. To build trust and drive the adoption of AI agents like Jarvis, Google will need to strike a balance between convenience and robust privacy protections.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Enhancing user experience and accessibility</h2>



<p>Beyond productivity, Jarvis has the potential to improve accessibility for a wide range of users. For those with disabilities, Jarvis could read web content aloud or use voice commands to assist with form navigation. For less tech-savvy users, Jarvis could simplify digital interactions by handling tasks like locating files or managing settings.</p>



<p>Jarvis could also assist in planning a busy workday or booking a trip by actively supporting task management. Project Jarvis aims to reimagine AI as a supportive digital partner, enhancing the user experience beyond that of a conventional tool.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai has announced a series of structural changes and leadership appointments aimed at accelerating the company&#8217;s AI initiatives.</p>



<p>The restructuring sees the Gemini app team, led by Sissie Hsiao, joining Google DeepMind under the leadership of Demis Hassabis.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bringing the teams closer together will improve feedback loops, enable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app, make our post-training work proceed more efficiently and build on our great product momentum,” Pichai explained.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Assistant teams focusing on devices and home experiences will be integrated into the Platforms &amp; Devices division. This reorganisation aims to align these teams more closely with the product surfaces they are developing for and consolidate AI smart home initiatives at Google under one umbrella.</p>



<p>Prabhakar Raghavan, a 12-year Google veteran, will transition from his current role to become the Chief Technologist at Google. Pichai praised Raghavan&#8217;s contributions, highlighting his leadership across various divisions including Research, Workspace, Ads, and Knowledge &amp; Information (K&amp;I).</p>



<p>&#8220;Prabhakar&#8217;s leadership journey at Google has been remarkable,&#8221; Pichai noted. &#8220;He led the Gmail team in launching Smart Reply and Smart Compose as early examples of using AI to improve products, and took Gmail and Drive past one billion users.&#8221;</p>



<p>Taking the helm of the K&amp;I division will be Nick Fox, a long-standing Googler and member of Raghavan&#8217;s leadership team. Fox&#8217;s appointment as SVP of K&amp;I comes on the back of his extensive experience across various facets of the company, including Product and Design in Search and Assistant, as well as Shopping, Travel, and Payments products.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nick has been instrumental in shaping Google&#8217;s AI product roadmap and collaborating closely with Prabhakar and his leadership team on K&amp;I&#8217;s strategy,&#8221; comments Pichai. &#8220;I frequently turn to Nick to tackle our most challenging product questions and he consistently delivers progress with tenacity, speed, and optimism.&#8221;</p>



<p>The restructuring comes amid a flurry of AI-driven innovations across Google&#8217;s product lineup. Recent developments include the viral success of NotebookLM with Audio Overviews, enhancements to information discovery in Search and Lens, the launch of a revamped Google Shopping platform tailored for the AI era, advancements like <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/alphaproteo-google-deepmind-protein-design-system/">AlphaProteo</a> that could revolutionise protein design, and updates to the <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/google-ushers-in-gemini-era-ai-advancements/">Gemini</a> family of models.</p>



<p>Pichai also highlighted a significant milestone in Google&#8217;s healthcare AI initiatives, revealing that their AI system for detecting diabetic retinopathy has conducted 600,000 screenings to date. The company plans to expand access to this technology across India and Thailand.</p>



<p>&#8220;AI moves faster than any technology before it. To keep increasing the pace of progress, we&#8217;ve been making shifts to simplify our structures along the way,&#8221; Pichai explained.</p>

<p>Google DeepMind has unveiled an AI system called AlphaProteo that can design novel proteins that successfully bind to target molecules, potentially revolutionising drug design and disease research.</p>



<p>AlphaProteo can generate new protein binders for diverse target proteins, including VEGF-A, which is associated with cancer and diabetes complications. Notably, this is the first time an AI tool has successfully designed a protein binder for VEGF-A.</p>



<p>The system&#8217;s performance is particularly impressive, achieving higher experimental success rates and binding affinities that are up to 300 times better than existing methods across seven target proteins tested:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="592" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-1024x592.jpg" alt="Chart demonstrating Google DeepMind's AlphaProteo success rate" class="wp-image-15995" srcset="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-1024x592.jpg 1024w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-768x444.jpg 768w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-346x200.jpg 346w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-380x220.jpg 380w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-350x202.jpg 350w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-100x58.jpg 100w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-60x35.jpg 60w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results.jpg 1232w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>(Credit: Google DeepMind)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Trained on vast amounts of protein data from the <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/">Protein Data Bank</a> and over 100 million predicted structures from <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/deepmind-releases-alphafold-database-nearly-all-human-protein-structures/">AlphaFold</a>, AlphaProteo has learned the intricacies of molecular binding. Given the structure of a target molecule and preferred binding locations, the system generates a candidate protein designed to bind at those specific sites.</p>



<p>To validate AlphaProteo&#8217;s capabilities, the team designed binders for a diverse range of target proteins, including viral proteins involved in infection and proteins associated with cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. The results were promising, with high binding success rates and best-in-class binding strengths observed across the board.</p>



<p>For instance, when targeting the viral protein BHRF1, 88% of AlphaProteo&#8217;s candidate molecules bound successfully in wet lab testing. On average, AlphaProteo binders exhibited 10 times stronger binding than the best existing design methods across the targets tested.</p>



<p>The system&#8217;s performance suggests it could significantly reduce the time required for initial experiments involving protein binders across a wide range of applications. However, the team acknowledges that AlphaProteo has limitations, as it was unable to design successful binders against TNFɑ (a protein associated with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.)</p>



<p>To ensure responsible development, Google DeepMind is collaborating with external experts to inform their phased approach to sharing this work and contributing to community efforts in developing best practices—including the NTI&#8217;s new <a href="https://www.nti.org/news/nti-convenes-the-first-international-ai-bio-forum/">AI Bio Forum</a>.</p>



<p>As the technology evolves, the team plans to work with the scientific community to leverage AlphaProteo on impactful biology problems and understand its limitations. They are also exploring drug design applications at Isomorphic Labs.</p>



<p>While AlphaProteo represents a significant step forward in protein design, achieving strong binding is typically just the first step in designing proteins for practical applications. There remain many bioengineering challenges to overcome in the research and development process.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Google DeepMind’s advancement holds tremendous potential for accelerating progress across a broad spectrum of research, including drug development, cell and tissue imaging, disease understanding and diagnosis, and even crop resistance to pests.</p>

<p>Chinese internet search provider Baidu has <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3275717/baidu-blocks-google-bing-scraping-content-amid-demand-data-used-ai-projects?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=section" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated its Wikipedia-like Baike service</a> to prevent Google and Microsoft Bing from scraping its content.</p>



<p>This change was observed in the latest update to the Baidu Baike robots.txt file, which denies access to Googlebot and Bingbot crawlers.</p>



<p>According to the Wayback Machine, the change took place on August 8. Previously, Google and Bing search engines were allowed to index Baidu Baike&#8217;s central repository, which includes almost 30 million entries, although some target subdomains on the website were restricted.</p>



<p>This action by Baidu comes amid increasing demand for large datasets used in training artificial intelligence models and applications. It follows similar moves by other companies to protect their online content. In July, Reddit blocked various search engines, except Google, from indexing its posts and discussions. Google, <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/openai-secures-key-partnership-with-reddit/">like Reddit</a>, has a financial agreement with Reddit for data access to train its AI services.</p>



<p>According to sources, in the past year, Microsoft considered restricting access to internet-search data for rival search engine operators; this was most relevant for those who used the data for chatbots and generative AI services.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Chinese Wikipedia, with its 1.43 million entries, remains available to search engine crawlers. A survey conducted by the South China Morning Post found that entries from Baidu Baike still appear on both Bing and Google searches. Perhaps the search engines continue to use older cached content.</p>



<p>Such a move is emerging against the background where developers of generative AI around the world are increasingly working with content publishers in a bid to access the highest-quality content for their projects. For instance, relatively recently, OpenAI signed an agreement with Time magazine to access the entire archive, dating back to the very first day of the magazine&#8217;s publication over a century ago. A similar partnership was <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/ft-and-openai-ink-partnership-web-scraping-criticism/">inked</a> with the Financial Times in April.</p>



<p>Baidu&#8217;s decision to restrict access to its Baidu Baike content for major search engines highlights the growing importance of data in the AI era. As companies invest heavily in AI development, the value of large, curated datasets has significantly increased. This has led to a shift in how online platforms manage access to their content, with many choosing to limit or monetise access to their data.</p>



<p>As the AI industry continues to evolve, it&#8217;s likely that more companies will reassess their data-sharing policies, potentially leading to further changes in how information is indexed and accessed across the internet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chinese organisations are utilising cloud services from Amazon and its competitors to gain access to advanced US AI chips and capabilities that they cannot otherwise obtain, according to a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-entities-turn-amazon-cloud-its-rivals-access-high-end-us-chips-ai-2024-08-23/">report</a> based on public tender documents.</p>



<p>In a comprehensive investigation, Reuters revealed how Chinese cloud access to US AI chips is facilitated through intermediaries. Over 50 tender documents posted in the past year revealed that at least 11 Chinese entities have sought access to restricted US technologies or cloud services. Four of these explicitly named Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a cloud service provider, though accessed through Chinese intermediaries rather than directly from AWS.</p>



<p>&#8220;AWS complies with all applicable US laws, including trade laws, regarding the provision of AWS services inside and outside of China,&#8221; an AWS spokesperson told Reuters.</p>



<p>The report highlights that while the US government has restricted the export of high-end AI chips to China, providing access to such chips or advanced AI models through the cloud is not a violation of US regulations. This loophole has raised concerns among US officials and lawmakers.</p>



<p>One example cited in the report involves Shenzhen University, which spent 200,000 yuan (£21,925) on an AWS account to access cloud servers powered by Nvidia A100 and H100 chips for an unspecified project. The university obtained this service via an intermediary, Yunda Technology Ltd Co. Neither Shenzhen University nor Yunda Technology responded to Reuters&#8217; requests for comment.</p>



<p>The investigation also revealed that Zhejiang Lab, a research institute developing its own large language model called GeoGPT, stated in a tender document that it intended to spend 184,000 yuan to purchase AWS cloud computing services. The institute claimed that its AI model could not get enough computing power from homegrown Alibaba cloud services.</p>



<p>Michael McCaul, chair of the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, told <em>Reuters</em>: &#8220;This loophole has been a concern of mine for years, and we are long overdue to address it.&#8221;</p>



<p>In response to these concerns, the US Commerce Department is tightening rules. A government spokeswoman told Reuters that they are &#8220;seeking additional resources to strengthen our existing controls that restrict PRC companies from accessing advanced AI chips through remote access to cloud computing capability.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Commerce Department has also proposed a rule that would require US cloud computing firms to verify large AI model users and notify authorities when they use US cloud computing services to train large AI models capable of &#8220;malicious cyber-enabled activity.&#8221;</p>



<p>The study also found that Chinese companies are seeking access to Microsoft&#8217;s cloud services. For example, Sichuan University stated in a tender filing that it was developing a generative AI platform and would purchase 40 million Microsoft Azure OpenAI tokens to help with project delivery.</p>



<p>Reuters’ report also indicated that Amazon has provided Chinese businesses with access to modern AI chips as well as advanced AI models such as Anthropic&#8217;s Claude, which they would not otherwise have had. This was demonstrated by public postings, tenders, and marketing materials evaluated by the news organisation.</p>



<p>Chu Ruisong, President of AWS Greater China, stated during a generative AI-themed conference in Shanghai in May that &#8220;Bedrock provides a selection of leading LLMs, including prominent closed-source models such as Anthropic&#8217;s Claude 3.&#8221;</p>



<p>The report overall emphasises the difficulty of regulating access to advanced computing resources in an increasingly interconnected global technological ecosystem. It focuses on the intricate relationship between US export laws, cloud service providers, and Chinese enterprises looking to improve their AI capabilities.</p>



<p>As the US government works to close this gap, the scenario raises concerns about the efficacy of present export controls and the potential need for more comprehensive laws that cover cloud-based access to banned technologies.</p>



<p>The findings of this paper are likely to feed ongoing discussions about technology transfer, national security, and the global AI race. As politicians and industry leaders analyse these findings, they may spark fresh discussions about how to balance technological cooperation with national security concerns in an era of rapid AI growth.</p>

<p>Google has unveiled its new range of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/technology/google-unveils-first-5g-phones-cuts-price-on-base-pixel-model-idUSKCN24Z24J/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pixel 9 smartphones</a>, emphasising their enhanced AI capabilities.</p>



<p>The company released the devices much earlier than usual, as Google typically presents new Pixel models in the autumn. However, compared to previous versions, the changes in the new models are revolutionary.</p>



<p>The new smartphones feature more advanced integrations of Google&#8217;s AI technology. For instance, one unique Pixel feature allows users to search for information and images within their screenshots, thanks to a more deeply integrated approach. Additionally, through the Gemini chatbot, some features of these smartphones are available as overlays from other apps.</p>



<p>At Alphabet&#8217;s Bay View campus in Mountain View, California, Rick Osterloh, the Senior Vice President of Devices and Services at Google, informed visitors that the company plans to focus on practical applications of AI. He spent time describing the &#8220;Gemini era&#8221; to the audience, which will commence with the creation of Google&#8217;s advanced AI model.</p>



<p>The Pixel 9 series offers several models. The base model, the Pixel 9, features a 6.3-inch screen and costs $799. A larger alternative, the Pixel 9 Pro XL, has a 6.8-inch screen. A slightly enhanced version, the Pixel 9 Pro, offers a better camera system, though its price is higher. The final option is the foldable Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p>



<p>Regarding the initial shipping date, Google stated at the event that the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL would ship in late August. The Pro and Pro Fold models will ship in September, with all models available for preorder starting August 13. During Google&#8217;s presentations at the event, Gemini&#8217;s new functions were showcased in a live demo, focusing on the latest conversation features. Additionally, the company announced updates to the product&#8217;s exterior design, the installation of Google&#8217;s advanced camera system, and the integration of the new Tensor G4 chip.</p>



<p>In addition to smartphones, the company unveiled new versions of the Pixel Watch 3 smartwatch and Pixel Buds Pro 2 wireless earbuds. The watch can track the user&#8217;s heart rate; if it stops, it will call emergency services. This feature will be available in the UK and the EU.</p>



<p>As reported by IDC, Google&#8217;s share in the global smartphone market was less than 1% in the second quarter of 2024. Samsung and Apple took the first and second places, with market shares of 18.9%, and 15.8%, respectively. In the US, Google ranks fourth among smartphone operating systems, holding 4.5% of the market share.</p>



<p>Industry analysts note that although Google Pixel is not among the best-selling smartphones, it showcases some of the benefits of the Android operating system. Android has become the dominant operating system, used by more than 80% of smartphone users worldwide. Consequently, many people, even those who have never used a Google Pixel, may indirectly experience and appreciate the features that Google products offer.</p>



<p>The event also touched upon Google&#8217;s further intentions and previous efforts to implement AI across its product lineup to stay at the top of the game. Not long ago, the company integrated AI improvements into its core products, including its search engine. Additionally, Google announced a content-sharing agreement it reached with Peloton. As a result, Fitbit Premium subscribers will have free access to the Peloton training class library.</p>
