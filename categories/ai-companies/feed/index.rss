										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The emerging US-China Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) rivalry could face a major policy transformation, as the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/2024_Comprehensive_List_of_Recommendations.pdf">recommends</a> a Manhattan Project-style initiative and restrictions on humanoid robots in its latest report to Congress.</p>



<p>Released in November 2024, the Commission&#8217;s <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/2024_Annual_Report_to_Congress.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual report</a> outlined <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/2024_Executive_Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">32 recommendations</a> that could fundamentally alter how the two countries interact, with artificial intelligence taking centre stage in a new chapter of strategic rivalry.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">US-China: the AGI moonshot and critical tech controls</h3>



<p>At the heart of the report lies an ambitious proposal: establishing a government-backed programme to develop AGI &#8211; AI systems that could match and potentially exceed human cognitive abilities. </p>



<p>However, the recommendation is just one piece of a larger technological puzzle, including export controls, investment screening, and new trade policies to preserve US technological advantages. </p>



<p>The proposed AGI initiative would provide multi-year contracts to leading AI companies, cloud providers, and data centre operators. It would be backed by the Defense Department&#8217;s highest priority, &#8220;DX Rating&#8221; &#8211; a designation typically reserved for critical national security projects. </p>



<p>This level of government involvement in AI development mirrors the urgency seen in previous technological races. It raises crucial questions about the role of state intervention in an industry primarily driven by private sector innovation.</p>



<p>The Commission&#8217;s tech-focused recommendations extend beyond AI. Notable proposals include restricting imports of Chinese-made autonomous humanoid robots with advanced dexterity, locomotion, and intelligence capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report also targets energy infrastructure products with remote monitoring capabilities, reflecting growing concerns about connected technologies in critical infrastructure. The report builds on existing export controls in the semiconductor space by recommending stronger oversight of technology transfers and investment flows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This comes as China continues to build domestic chip-making capabilities despite international restrictions. The Commission suggests creating an Outbound Investment Office that prevents US capital and expertise from advancing China&#8217;s technological capabilities in sensitive sectors.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reshaping trade relations and investment flows</h3>



<p>Perhaps most significantly, the report recommends eliminating China&#8217;s Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status—a move that could reshape the technology supply chain and trade flows that have defined the global tech industry for decades. This recommendation acknowledges how deeply intertwined the US and Chinese tech ecosystems have become, while suggesting that this interdependence may now pose more risks than benefits.</p>



<p>Data transparency is another key theme, with recommendations for expanded reporting requirements on investments and technology transfers. The Commission calls for better tracking of investments flowing through offshore entities, addressing a significant blind-spot in current oversight mechanisms.</p>



<p>The report&#8217;s release comes at a critical juncture in technological development. China&#8217;s push for self-sufficiency in vital technologies and its &#8220;new quality productive forces&#8221; initiative demonstrates Beijing&#8217;s determination to lead in next-generation technologies. Meanwhile, AI capabilities and quantum computing breakthroughs have raised the stakes in technology competition.</p>



<p>However, the Commission&#8217;s recommendations face practical challenges. Achieving AGI remains a complex scientific challenge that may not yield quick results, regardless of funding levels. Additionally, restrictions on technology transfers and investment could have unintended consequences for global innovation networks that have historically benefited both nations.</p>



<p>If these recommendations are implemented, the tech industry may need to navigate an increasingly complex regulatory landscape. Companies would face new compliance requirements for international investments, technology transfers, and collaborative research projects.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges and future implications</h3>



<p>The effectiveness of the proposed measures will likely depend on coordination with allies and partners who share similar technological capabilities and concerns. The report acknowledges this by recommending multilateral approaches to export controls and investment screening.</p>



<p>US-China technological competition has entered a new phase where government policy may play a more direct role in shaping development. Whether this approach accelerates or hinders innovation remains to be seen, but the tech industry should prepare for increased scrutiny and regulation of international technological collaboration.</p>

<p>As we approach a new year filled with potential, the landscape of technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), is on the brink of significant transformation. Manish Jethwa, CTO at Ordnance Survey (OS), the national mapping agency for Great Britain, offers an insightful glimpse into what we can expect from these advancements and their implications for the geospatial sector.</p>



<p><strong>Breaking Down Barriers with AI</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="512" height="489" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16778" style="width:314px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394.jpg 512w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-300x287.jpg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-209x200.jpg 209w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-298x285.jpg 298w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-262x250.jpg 262w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-100x96.jpg 100w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-60x57.jpg 60w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure></div>


<p>Looking ahead, Jethwa anticipates continued significant advancements in AI and machine learning, particularly with the push towards Gen AI. According to him, the integration of large language models (LLMs) with more sophisticated agents will not only perform complex tasks on behalf of users but also further reduce barriers to interaction. This shift, especially in the geospatial field, means that translating natural language into precise data queries will become more seamless, ultimately making geospatial datasets more accessible, mainstream, and user-friendly.</p>



<p><strong>Training for Complex Tasks</strong></p>



<p>Beyond LLMs, Jethwa is optimistic about progress in the broader category of machine learning, driven by greater access to graphics processing units for training.</p>



<p>He says: “At Ordnance Survey (OS), we’ll leverage this capability to train models for specific, complex tasks such as automatic feature extraction from imagery.</p>



<p>“With an increasing volume of data generated automatically, hopefully next year will also bring innovative tools and techniques to validate data, ensuring it can be confidently utilised for its intended use.”</p>



<p>He underscores the importance of not only pursuing new capabilities but also ensuring that these tools are integrated responsibly into workflows, focusing on quality and risk management.</p>



<p><strong>The Ethical Frontier</strong></p>



<p>The rapid evolution of AI brings with it an urgent need for ethical considerations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jethwa explains: “I would like to see a greater emphasis on ethical AI and responsible technology development,&#8221; including creating AI systems that are “transparent, fair, and unbiased” while also considering their environmental and societal impact.</p>



<p>This focus on ethics is encapsulated in OS’s Responsible AI Charter, which guides their approach to integrating new techniques safely.</p>



<p>Moreover, Jethwa highlights the role of workforce development in successful transformations. He believes organisations must commit to “retraining and upskilling employees to prepare them for the impact of AI and digital transformation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is vital to ensure that in the pursuit of enhanced efficiency, companies do not “lose the personality, creativity, and emotion that we bring as humans into the workplace.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Embracing Change While Managing Risks</strong></p>



<p>Despite the promise of technological advancements, obstacles remain in the journey toward digital transformation. Jethwa notes that challenges such as “cultural resistance and rapid successive changes leading to change fatigue will likely persist.” </p>



<p>He advocates for a careful balance between adopting new technologies and addressing the human elements of transformation processes.</p>



<p>As AI continues to influence various aspects of business, from decision-making to risk management, the issue of cybersecurity also looms large. Jethwa points out that “cybersecurity threats being powered by AI are becoming more sophisticated,” urging companies to develop comprehensive strategies that cover everything from data storage to analysis documentation.</p>



<p><strong>The Imperative to Progress</strong></p>



<p>In an evolving landscape, organisations that stagnate risk falling behind their competitors. Jethwa explains: “Companies that fail to keep up open themselves up to risks, such as changing customer expectations as well as attracting and retaining talent.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also emphasises the need for a “clear vision of future goals, effective communication of progress, and celebrating milestones to sustain momentum” in digital transformation initiatives.</p>



<p>As we move into a new year filled with promise, the future of AI and geospatial technology holds transformative power &#8211; but it must be used responsibly. The path that lies ahead in 2025 requires vigilance, an unwavering commitment to ethical practices and a human touch in order to drive successful innovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Amazon has announced <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/amazon-partners-anthropic-enhance-alexa/">an additional</a> $4 billion investment in Anthropic, bringing the company&#8217;s total commitment to $8 billion, part of its expanding artificial intelligence strategy. The investment was <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-invests-additional-4-billion-anthropic-ai">announced</a> on November 22, 2024 and strengthens Amazon&#8217;s position in the AI sector, building on its established cloud computing services in the form of AWS. </p>



<p>While maintaining Amazon&#8217;s minority stake in Anthropic, the investment represents a significant development in the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/anthropic-urges-ai-regulation-avoid-catastrophes/">approach to AI technology</a> and cloud infrastructure. The expanded collaboration goes beyond mere financial investment. Anthropic has now designated AWS as its &#8220;primary training partner&#8221; for AI model development, in addition to Amazon&#8217;s role as a primary cloud provider. </p>



<p>Amazon&#8217;s investment will see Anthropic utilizing AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips for training and on which to deploy its future foundational models, including any updates to the flagship Claude AI system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AWS&#8217;s competitive edge</h3>



<p>The continuing partnership provides Amazon with several strategic advantages in the competitive cloud computing and AI services market:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Hardware innovation</strong>: The commitment to use AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips for Anthropic&#8217;s advanced AI models validates Amazon&#8217;s investment in custom AI chips and positions AWS as a serious competitor to NVIDIA in the AI infrastructure space.</li>



<li><strong>Cloud service enhancement</strong>: AWS customers will receive early access to fine-tuning capabilities for data processed by Anthropic models. This benefit alone could attract more enterprises to Amazon&#8217;s cloud platform.</li>



<li><strong>Model performance</strong>: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Anthropic&#8217;s <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/anthropic-new-claude-ai-models-and-computer-control/">latest model</a> available through Amazon Bedrock, has demonstrated exceptional performance in agentic coding tasks, according to Anthropic.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Amazon&#8217;s multi-faceted AI strategy</h3>



<p>While the increased investment in Anthropic is impressive in monetary terms, it represents just one component of Amazon&#8217;s broader AI strategy. The company appears to be pursuing a multi-pronged approach:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>External partnerships: </strong>The Anthropic investment provides immediate access to cutting-edge AI capabilities from third-parties.</li>



<li><strong>Internal development:</strong>&nbsp;Amazon continues to develop its own AI models and capabilities.</li>



<li><strong>Infrastructure development:</strong> Ongoing investment in AI-specific hardware like Trainium chips demonstrates a commitment to building AI-focussed infrastructure.</li>
</ol>



<p>The expanded partnership signals Amazon&#8217;s long-term commitment to AI development yet retains flexibility thanks to its minority stakeholding. This approach allows Amazon to benefit from Anthropic&#8217;s innovations while preserving the ability to pursue other partnerships with external AI companies and continue internal development initiatives.</p>



<p>The investment reinforces the growing trend where major tech companies seek strategic AI partnerships rather than relying solely on internal development. It also highlights the important role of cloud infrastructure in the AI industry&#8217;s growth. AWS has positioned itself as a suitable platform for AI model training and deployment.</p>

<p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai has announced the launch of Gemini 2.0, a model that represents the next step in Google’s ambition to revolutionise AI.</p>



<p>A year after introducing the Gemini 1.0 model, this major upgrade incorporates enhanced multimodal capabilities, agentic functionality, and innovative user tools designed to push boundaries in AI-driven technology.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Leap towards transformational AI&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Reflecting on Google’s 26-year mission to organise and make the world’s information accessible, Pichai remarked, “If Gemini 1.0 was about organising and understanding information, Gemini 2.0 is about making it much more useful.”</p>



<p>Gemini 1.0, released in December 2022, was notable for being Google’s first natively multimodal AI model. The first iteration excelled at understanding and processing text, video, images, audio, and code. Its enhanced 1.5 version became widely embraced by developers for its long-context understanding, enabling applications such as the productivity-focused NotebookLM.</p>



<p>Now, with Gemini 2.0, Google aims to accelerate the role of AI as a universal assistant capable of native image and audio generation, better reasoning and planning, and real-world decision-making capabilities. In Pichai&#8217;s words, the development represents the dawn of an “agentic era.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Introducing Gemini 2.0 | Our most capable AI model yet" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fs0t6SdODd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>“We have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision,” Pichai explained.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gemini 2.0: Core features and availability</h3>



<p>At the heart of today&#8217;s announcement is the experimental release of Gemini 2.0 Flash, the flagship model of Gemini’s second generation. It builds upon the foundations laid by its predecessors while delivering faster response times and advanced performance.</p>



<p>Gemini 2.0 Flash supports multimodal inputs and outputs, including the ability to generate native images in conjunction with text and produce steerable text-to-speech multilingual audio. Additionally, users can benefit from native tool integration such as Google Search and even third-party user-defined functions.</p>



<p>Developers and businesses will gain access to Gemini 2.0 Flash via the Gemini API in <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/">Google AI Studio</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai">Vertex AI</a>, while larger model sizes are scheduled for broader release in January 2024.</p>



<p>For global accessibility, the Gemini app now features a chat-optimised version of the 2.0 Flash experimental model. Early adopters can experience this updated assistant on desktop and mobile, with a mobile app rollout imminent.</p>



<p>Products such as Google Search are also being enhanced with Gemini 2.0, unlocking the ability to handle complex queries like advanced math problems, coding enquiries, and multimodal questions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Comprehensive suite of AI innovations&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The launch of Gemini 2.0 comes with compelling new tools that showcase its capabilities.</p>



<p>One such feature, Deep Research, functions as an AI research assistant, simplifying the process of investigating complex topics by compiling information into comprehensive reports. Another upgrade enhances Search with Gemini-enabled AI Overviews that tackle intricate, multi-step user queries.</p>



<p>The model was trained using Google’s sixth-generation Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), known as Trillium, which Pichai notes “powered 100% of Gemini 2.0 training and inference.”</p>



<p>Trillium is now <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/trillium-tpu-is-ga">available</a> for external developers, allowing them to benefit from the same infrastructure that supports Google’s own advancements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pioneering agentic experiences&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Accompanying Gemini 2.0 are experimental “agentic” prototypes built to explore the future of human-AI collaboration, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Project Astra: A universal AI assistant</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>First introduced at I/O earlier this year, Project Astra taps into Gemini 2.0’s multimodal understanding to improve real-world AI interactions. Trusted testers have trialled the assistant on Android, offering feedback that has helped refine its multilingual dialogue, memory retention, and integration with Google tools like Search, Lens, and Maps. Astra has also demonstrated near-human conversational latency, with further research underway for its application in wearable technology, such as prototype AI glasses.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Project Mariner: Redefining web automation </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Project Mariner is an experimental web-browsing assistant that uses Gemini 2.0’s ability to reason across text, images, and interactive elements like forms within a browser. In initial tests, it achieved an 83.5% success rate on the WebVoyager benchmark for completing end-to-end web tasks. Early testers using a Chrome extension are helping to refine Mariner’s capabilities while Google evaluates safety measures that ensure the technology remains user-friendly and secure.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Jules: A coding agent for developers  </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Jules, an AI-powered assistant built for developers, integrates directly into GitHub workflows to address coding challenges. It can autonomously propose solutions, generate plans, and execute code-based tasks—all under human supervision. This experimental endeavour is part of Google’s long-term goal to create versatile AI agents across various domains.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Gaming applications and beyond  </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Extending Gemini 2.0’s reach into virtual environments, Google DeepMind is working with gaming partners like Supercell on intelligent game agents. These experimental AI companions can interpret game actions in real-time, suggest strategies, and even access broader knowledge via Search. Research is also being conducted into how Gemini 2.0’s spatial reasoning could support robotics, opening doors for physical-world applications in the future.</p>

</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Addressing responsibility in AI development</h3>



<p>As AI capabilities expand, Google emphasises the importance of prioritising safety and ethical considerations.</p>



<p>Google claims Gemini 2.0 underwent extensive risk assessments, bolstered by the Responsibility and Safety Committee’s oversight to mitigate potential risks. Additionally, its embedded reasoning abilities allow for <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/openai-enhances-ai-safety-new-red-teaming-methods/">advanced “red-teaming,”</a> enabling developers to evaluate security scenarios and optimise safety measures at scale.</p>



<p>Google is also exploring safeguards to address user privacy, prevent misuse, and ensure AI agents remain reliable. For instance, Project Mariner is designed to prioritise user instructions while resisting malicious prompt injections, preventing threats like phishing or fraudulent transactions. Meanwhile, privacy controls in Project Astra make it easy for users to manage session data and deletion preferences.</p>



<p>Pichai reaffirmed the company’s commitment to responsible development, stating, “We firmly believe that the only way to build AI is to be responsible from the start.”</p>



<p>With the Gemini 2.0 Flash release, Google is edging closer to its vision of building a universal assistant capable of transforming interactions across domains.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS) has announced improvements to bolster Bedrock, its fully managed generative AI service.</p>



<p>The updates include new foundational models from several AI pioneers, enhanced data processing capabilities, and features aimed at improving inference efficiency.</p>



<p>Dr Swami Sivasubramanian, VP of AI and Data at AWS, said: “Amazon Bedrock continues to see rapid growth as customers flock to the service for its broad selection of leading models, tools to easily customise with their data, built-in responsible AI features, and capabilities for developing sophisticated agents.</p>



<p>“With this new set of capabilities, we are empowering customers to develop more intelligent AI applications that will deliver greater value to their end-users.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Amazon Bedrock expands its model diversity</h3>



<p>AWS is set to become the first cloud provider to feature models from AI developers Luma AI and poolside, while also incorporating Stability AI’s latest release.</p>



<p>Through its new <em>Amazon Bedrock Marketplace</em>, customers will have access to over 100 emerging and specialised models from across industries, ensuring they can select the most appropriate tools for their unique needs.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Luma AI’s Ray 2</strong> </li>
</ul>



<p>Luma AI, known for advancing generative AI in video content creation, brings its next-generation Ray 2 model to Amazon Bedrock. This model generates high-quality, lifelike video outputs from text or image inputs and allows organisations to create detailed outputs in fields such as fashion, architecture, and graphic design. AWS’s presence as the first provider for this model ensures businesses can experiment with new camera angles, cinematographic styles, and consistent characters with a frictionless workflow.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>poolside’s </strong><strong><em>malibu</em></strong><strong> and </strong><strong><em>point</em></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Designed to address challenges in modern software engineering, poolside’s models – <em>malibu</em> and <em>point</em> – specialise in code generation, testing, documentation, and real-time code completion. Importantly, developers can securely fine-tune these models using their private datasets. Accompanied by Assistant – an integration for development environments – poolside’s tools allow engineering teams to accelerate productivity, ship projects faster, and increase accuracy.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large  </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Amazon Bedrock customers will soon gain access to Stability AI’s text-to-image model <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/stability-ai-releases-most-powerful-image-generation-models-date/">Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large</a>. This addition supports businesses in creating high-quality visual media for use cases in areas like gaming, advertising, and retail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through the Bedrock Marketplace, AWS also enables access to over 100 specialised models. These include solutions tailored to fields such as biology (EvolutionaryScale’s ESM3 generative model), financial data (Writer’s Palmyra-Fin), and media (Camb.ai’s text-to-audio MARS6).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="692" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-1024x692.jpg" alt="Image showing the expanded AI model catalog in the Amazon Bedrock Marketplace." class="wp-image-16656" srcset="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-1024x692.jpg 1024w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-300x203.jpg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-768x519.jpg 768w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-296x200.jpg 296w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-380x257.jpg 380w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-350x237.jpg 350w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-100x68.jpg 100w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-60x41.jpg 60w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence.jpg 1294w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Zendesk, a global customer service software firm, leverages Bedrock’s marketplace to personalise support across email and social channels using AI-driven localisation and sentiment analysis tools. For example, they use models like Widn.AI to tailor responses based on real-time sentiment in customers’ native languages.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Scaling inference with new Amazon Bedrock features</h3>



<p>Large-scale generative AI applications require balancing the cost, latency, and accuracy of inference processes. AWS is addressing this challenge with two new Amazon Bedrock features:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Prompt Caching</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The new caching capability reduces redundant processing of prompts by securely storing frequently used queries, saving on both time and costs. This feature can lead to up to a 90% reduction in costs and an 85% decrease in latency. For example, Adobe incorporated Prompt Caching into its Acrobat AI Assistant to summarise documents and answer questions, achieving a 72% reduction in response times during initial testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Intelligent Prompt Routing</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>This feature dynamically directs prompts to the most suitable foundation model within a family, optimising results for both cost and quality. Customers such as Argo Labs, which builds conversational voice AI solutions for restaurants, have already benefited. While simpler queries (like booking tables) are handled by smaller models, more nuanced requests (e.g., dietary-specific menu questions) are intelligently routed to larger models. Argo Labs’ usage of intelligent Prompt Routing has not only improved response quality but also reduced costs by up to 30%.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Data utilisation: Knowledge bases and automation</h3>



<p>A key attraction of generative AI lies in its ability to extract value from data. AWS is enhancing its Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to ensure organisations can deploy their unique datasets for richer AI-powered user experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Using structured data </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>AWS has introduced capabilities for structured data retrieval within Knowledge Bases. This enhancement allows customers to query data stored across Amazon services like SageMaker Lakehouse and Redshift through natural-language prompts, with results translated back into SQL queries. Octus, a credit intelligence firm, plans to use this capability to provide clients with dynamic, natural-language reports on its structured financial data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>GraphRAG integration </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>By incorporating automated graph modelling (powered by Amazon Neptune), customers can now generate and connect relational data for stronger AI applications. BMW Group, for instance, will use GraphRAG to augment its virtual assistant MAIA. This assistant taps into BMW’s wealth of internal data to deliver comprehensive responses and premium user experiences.</p>



<p>Separately, AWS has unveiled Amazon Bedrock Data Automation, a tool that transforms unstructured content (e.g., documents, video, and audio) into structured formats for analytics or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Companies like Symbeo (automated claims processing) and Tenovos (digital asset management) are already piloting the tool to improve operational efficiency and data reuse.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Amazon Bedrock Data Automation Overview | Amazon Web Services" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s54hx76QD5k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The expansion of Amazon Bedrock’s ecosystem reflects its growing popularity, with the service recording a 4.7x increase in its customer base over the last year. Industry leaders like Adobe, BMW, Zendesk, and Tenovos have all embraced AWS’s latest innovations to improve their generative AI capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the newly announced tools – such as inference management, Knowledge Bases with structured data retrieval, and GraphRAG – are currently in preview, while notable model releases from Luma AI, poolside, and Stability AI are expected soon.</p>

<p>Google Cloud has launched two generative AI models on its <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai">Vertex AI</a> platform, Veo and Imagen 3, amid reports of surging revenue growth among enterprises leveraging the technology.</p>



<p>According to Google Cloud&#8217;s data, 86% of enterprise companies currently using generative AI in production environments have witnessed increased revenue, with an estimated average growth of 6%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This metric has driven the tech giant&#8217;s latest innovation push, resulting in the introduction of Veo – its most sophisticated video generation model to date – and Imagen 3, an advanced text-to-image generation system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Breaking ground</h3>



<p><a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/">Veo</a>, now available in private preview on Vertex AI, represents a milestone as Google becomes the first hyperscaler to offer an image-to-video model. The technology enables businesses to generate high-quality videos from simple text or image prompts, potentially revolutionising video production workflows across industries.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Transforming operations</h3>



<p>Several major firms have begun implementing these technologies into their operations.</p>



<p>Mondelez International, the company behind brands such as Oreo, Cadbury, and Chips Ahoy!, is using the technology to accelerate campaign content creation across its global portfolio of brands.</p>



<p>Jon Halvorson, SVP of Consumer Experience &amp; Digital Commerce at Mondelez International, explained: &#8220;Our collaboration with Google Cloud has been instrumental in harnessing the power of generative AI, notably through Imagen 3, to revolutionise content production.</p>



<p>“This technology has enabled us to produce hundreds of thousands of customised assets, enhancing creative quality while significantly reducing both time to market and costs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Knowledge sharing platform Quora has developed <a href="https://poe.com/">Poe</a>, a platform that enables users to interact with generative AI models. Veo and Imagen are now integrated with Poe.</p>



<p>Spencer Chan, Product Lead for Poe at Quora, commented: “We created Poe to democratise access to the world&#8217;s best gen AI models. With Veo, we&#8217;re now enabling millions of users to bring their ideas to life through stunning, high-quality generative video.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Safety and security</h3>



<p>In response to growing concerns about AI-generated content, <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/categories/ai-companies/google/">Google</a> has implemented robust safety features in both models. These include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Digital watermarking</strong> through Google DeepMind&#8217;s SynthID.</li>



<li><strong>Built-in safety filters</strong> to prevent harmful content creation.</li>



<li><strong>Strict data governance policies</strong> ensure customer data protection.</li>



<li><strong>Industry-first copyright indemnity</strong> for generative AI services.</li>
</ul>



<p>The launch of these new models signals Google&#8217;s growing influence in the enterprise AI space and suggests a shift toward more sophisticated, integrated AI solutions for business applications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Salesforce has unveiled the findings of its <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/uk/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/12/Salesforce-UK-AI-Readiness-Index.pdf">UK AI Readiness Index</a>, signalling the nation is in a position to spearhead the next wave of AI innovation, also known as agentic AI.</p>



<p>The report places the UK ahead of its G7 counterparts in terms of AI adoption but also underscores areas ripe for improvement, such as support for SMEs, fostering cross-sector partnerships, and investing in talent development.</p>



<p>Zahra Bahrololoumi CBE, UKI CEO at Salesforce, commented: “Agentic AI is revolutionising enterprise software by enabling humans and agents to collaborate seamlessly and drive customer success.</p>



<p>“The UK AI Readiness Index positively highlights that the UK has both the vision and infrastructure to be a powerhouse globally in AI, and lead the current third wave of agentic AI.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">UK AI adoption sets the stage for agentic revolution</h3>



<p>The Index details how both the public and private sectors in the UK have embraced AI&#8217;s transformative potential. With a readiness score of 65.5, surpassing the G7 average of 61.2, the UK is establishing itself as a hub for large-scale AI projects, driven by a robust innovation culture and pragmatic regulatory approaches.</p>



<p>The government has played its part in maintaining a stable and secure environment for tech investment. Initiatives such as the <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/uk-reveals-ai-safety-summit-opening-day-agenda/">AI Safety Summit</a> at Bletchley Park and risk-oriented AI legislation showcase Britain&#8217;s leadership on critical AI issues like transparency and privacy.</p>



<p>Business readiness is equally impressive, with UK industries scoring 52, well above the G7 average of 47.8. SMEs in the UK are increasingly prioritising AI adoption, further bolstering the nation&#8217;s stance in the international AI arena.</p>



<p>Adam Evans, EVP &amp; GM of Salesforce AI Platform, is optimistic about the evolution of agentic AI. Evans foresees that, by 2025, these agents will become business-aware—expertly navigating industry-specific challenges to execute meaningful tasks and decisions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Investments fuelling AI growth</h3>



<p>Salesforce is committing $4 billion to the UK’s AI ecosystem over the next five years. Since establishing its UK AI Centre in London, Salesforce says it has engaged over 3,000 stakeholders in AI training and workshops.</p>



<p>Key investment focuses include creating a regulatory bridge between the EU’s <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/balancing-innovation-trust-experts-assess-eu-ai-act/">rules-based approach</a> and the more relaxed US approach, and ensuring SMEs have the resources to integrate AI. A strong emphasis also lies on enhancing digital skills and centralising training to support the AI workforce of the future.</p>



<p>Feryal Clark, Minister for AI and Digital Government, said: &#8220;These findings are further proof the UK is in prime position to take advantage of AI, and highlight our strength in spurring innovation, investment, and collaboration across the public and private sector.</p>



<p>“There is a global race for AI and we’ll be setting out plans for how the UK can use the technology to ramp-up adoption across the economy, kickstart growth, and build an AI sector which can scale and compete on the global stage.”</p>



<p>Antony Walker, Deputy CEO at techUK, added: “To build this progress, government and industry must collaborate to foster innovation, support SMEs, invest in skills, and ensure flexible regulation, cementing the UK’s leadership in the global AI economy.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Agentic AI boosting UK business productivity&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Capita, Secret Escapes, Heathrow, and Bionic are among the organisations that have adopted Salesforce’s Agentforce to boost their productivity.</p>



<p>Adolfo Hernandez, CEO of Capita, said: &#8220;We want to transform Capita’s recruitment process into a fast, seamless and autonomous experience that benefits candidates, our people, and our clients.</p>



<p>“With autonomous agents providing 24/7 support, our goal is to enable candidates to complete the entire recruitment journey within days as opposed to what has historically taken weeks.</p>



<p>Secret Escapes, a curator of luxury travel deals, finds autonomous agents crucial for personalising services to its 60 million European members.</p>



<p>Kate Donaghy, Head of Business Technology at Secret Escapes, added: “Agentforce uses our unified data to automate routine tasks like processing cancellations, updating booking information, or even answering common travel questions about luggage, flight information, and much more—freeing up our customer service agents to handle more complex and last-minute travel needs to better serve our members.”</p>



<p>The UK’s AI readiness is testament to the synergy between government, business, and academia. To maintain its leadership, the UK must sustain its focus on collaboration, skills development, and innovation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OpenAI and other leading AI companies are developing new training techniques to overcome limitations of current methods. Addressing unexpected delays and complications in the development of larger, more powerful language models, these fresh techniques focus on human-like behaviour to teach algorithms to &#8216;think.</p>



<p>Reportedly led by a dozen AI researchers, scientists, and investors, the new training techniques, which underpin OpenAI&#8217;s recent <a href="https://openai.com/o1/">&#8216;o1&#8217; model</a> (formerly Q* and Strawberry), have the potential to transform the landscape of AI development. The reported advances may influence the types or quantities of resources AI companies need continuously, including specialised hardware and energy to aid the development of AI models.</p>



<p>The o1 model is designed to approach problems in a way that mimics human reasoning and thinking, breaking down numerous tasks into steps. The model also utilises specialised data and feedback provided by experts in the AI industry to enhance its performance.</p>



<p>Since ChatGPT was unveiled by OpenAI in 2022, there has been a surge in AI innovation, and many technology companies claim existing AI models require expansion, be it through greater quantities of data or improved computing resources. Only then can AI models consistently improve.</p>



<p>Now, AI experts have reported limitations in scaling up AI models. The 2010s were a revolutionary period for scaling, but Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, says that the training of AI models, particularly in the understanding language structures and patterns, has levelled off.</p>



<p>&#8220;The 2010s were the age of scaling, now we&#8217;re back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Scaling the right thing matters more now,&#8221; they said.</p>



<p>In recent times, AI lab researchers have experienced delays in and challenges to developing and releasing large language models (LLM) that are more powerful than OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-4 model.</p>



<p>First, there is the cost of training large models, often running into tens of millions of dollars. And, due to complications that arise, like hardware failing due to system complexity, a final analysis of how these models run can take months.</p>



<p>In addition to these challenges, training runs require substantial amounts of energy, often resulting in power shortages that can disrupt processes and impact the wider electriciy grid. Another issue is the colossal amount of data large language models use, so much so that AI models have reportedly used up all accessible data worldwide.</p>



<p>Researchers are exploring a technique known as &#8216;test-time compute&#8217; to improve current AI models when being trained or during inference phases. The method can involve the generation of multiple answers in real-time to decide on a range of best solutions. Therefore, the model can allocate greater processing resources to difficult tasks that require human-like decision-making and reasoning. The aim &#8211; to make the model more accurate and capable.</p>



<p>Noam Brown, a researcher at OpenAI who helped develop the o1 model, shared an example of how a new approach can achieve surprising results. At the TED AI conference in San Francisco last month, Brown explained that &#8220;having a bot think for just 20 seconds in a hand of poker got the same boosting performance as scaling up the model by 100,000x and training it for 100,000 times longer.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rather than simply increasing the model size and training time, this can change how AI models process information and lead to more powerful, efficient systems.</p>



<p>It is reported that other AI labs have been developing versions of the o1 technique. The include <a href="https://x.ai/">xAI</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.google/">Google DeepMind</a>, and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>. Competition in the AI world is nothing new, but we could see a significant impact on the AI hardware market as a result of new techniques. Companies like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/">Nvidia</a>, which currently dominates the supply of AI chips due to the high demand for their products, may be particularly affected by updated AI training techniques.</p>



<p>Nvidia became the world&#8217;s most valuable company in October, and its rise in fortunes can be largely attributed to its chips&#8217; use in AI arrays. New techniques may impact Nvidia&#8217;s market position, forcing the company to adapt its products to meet the evolving AI hardware demand. Potentially, this could open more avenues for new competitors in the inference market.</p>



<p>A new age of AI development may be on the horizon, driven by evolving hardware demands and more efficient training methods such as those deployed in the o1 model. The future of both AI models and the companies behind them could be reshaped, unlocking unprecedented possibilities and greater competition.</p>

<p><a href="https://allenai.org/">Ai2</a> is releasing OLMo 2, a family of open-source language models that advances the democratisation of AI and narrows the gap between open and proprietary solutions.</p>



<p>The new models, available in 7B and 13B parameter versions, are trained on up to 5 trillion tokens and demonstrate performance levels that match or exceed comparable fully open models whilst remaining competitive with open-weight models such as Llama 3.1 on English academic benchmarks.</p>



<p>&#8220;Since the release of the first OLMo in February 2024, we&#8217;ve seen rapid growth in the open language model ecosystem, and a narrowing of the performance gap between open and proprietary models,&#8221; explained Ai2.</p>



<p>The development team achieved these improvements through several innovations, including enhanced training stability measures, staged training approaches, and state-of-the-art post-training methodologies derived from their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15124">Tülu 3</a> framework. Notable technical improvements include the switch from nonparametric layer norm to RMSNorm and the implementation of rotary positional embedding.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">OLMo 2 model training breakthrough</h3>



<p>The training process employed a sophisticated two-stage approach. The initial stage utilised the OLMo-Mix-1124 dataset of approximately 3.9 trillion tokens, sourced from DCLM, Dolma, Starcoder, and Proof Pile II. The second stage incorporated a carefully curated mixture of high-quality web data and domain-specific content through the Dolmino-Mix-1124 dataset.</p>



<p>Particularly noteworthy is the OLMo 2-Instruct-13B variant, which is the most capable model in the series. The model demonstrates superior performance compared to Qwen 2.5 14B instruct, Tülu 3 8B, and Llama 3.1 8B instruct models across various benchmarks.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Commiting to open science</h3>



<p>Reinforcing its commitment to open science, Ai2 has released comprehensive documentation including weights, data, code, recipes, intermediate checkpoints, and instruction-tuned models. This transparency allows for full inspection and reproduction of results by the wider AI community.</p>



<p>The release also introduces an evaluation framework called OLMES (Open Language Modeling Evaluation System), comprising 20 benchmarks designed to assess core capabilities such as knowledge recall, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical reasoning.</p>



<p>OLMo 2 raises the bar in open-source AI development, potentially accelerating the pace of innovation in the field whilst maintaining transparency and accessibility.</p>
