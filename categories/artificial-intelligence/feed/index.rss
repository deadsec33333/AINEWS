<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Shift to Smarter Surveillance</h3>



<p>Traditional video surveillance systems often fail to meet the needs of dynamic, modern environments. Whether it&#8217;s a retail chain looking to analyse customer behaviour or a factory monitoring equipment safety, the tools of yesterday aren&#8217;t enough to address today&#8217;s demands.</p>



<p>The shift towards smarter surveillance involves integrating modular, AI-driven systems that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Adapt to your specific needs,</li>



<li>Automate tedious tasks like footage analysis,</li>



<li>Offer advanced analytics, like emotion detection or license plate recognition,</li>



<li>Remain accessible to both tech-savvy professionals and beginners.</li>
</ul>



<p>This isn&#8217;t just a technical shift; it&#8217;s a shift in mindset. Businesses now see surveillance not only as a security measure but as a strategic tool for operational insight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>OpenAI is awarding a $1 million grant to a Duke University research team to look at how AI could predict human moral judgments.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.eweek.com/news/openai-funding-ai-morality-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initiative</a> highlights the growing focus on the intersection of technology and ethics, and raises critical questions: Can AI handle the complexities of morality, or should ethical decisions remain the domain of humans?</p>



<p>Duke University’s Moral Attitudes and Decisions Lab (MADLAB), led by ethics professor Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and co-investigator Jana Schaich Borg, is in charge of the “Making Moral AI” project. The team envisions a “moral GPS,” a tool that could guide ethical decision-making.</p>



<p>Its research spans diverse fields, including computer science, philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, to understand how moral attitudes and decisions are formed and how AI can contribute to the process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The role of AI in morality</h3>



<p>MADLAB’s work examines how AI might predict or influence moral judgments. Imagine an algorithm assessing ethical dilemmas, such as deciding between two unfavourable outcomes in autonomous vehicles or providing guidance on ethical business practices. Such scenarios underscore AI’s potential but also raise fundamental questions: Who determines the moral framework guiding these types of tools, and should AI be trusted to make decisions with ethical implications?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">OpenAI’s vision</h3>



<p>The grant supports the development of algorithms that forecast human moral judgments in areas such as medical, law, and business, which frequently involve complex ethical trade-offs. While promising, AI still struggles to grasp the emotional and cultural nuances of morality. Current systems excel at recognising patterns but lack the deeper understanding required for ethical reasoning.</p>



<p>Another concern is how this technology might be applied. While AI could assist in life-saving decisions, its use in defence strategies or surveillance introduces moral dilemmas. Can unethical AI actions be justified if they serve national interests or align with societal goals? These questions emphasise the difficulties of embedding morality into AI systems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges and opportunities</h3>



<p>Integrating ethics into AI is a formidable challenge that requires collaboration across disciplines. Morality is not universal; it is shaped by cultural, personal, and societal values, making it difficult to encode into algorithms. Additionally, without safeguards such as transparency and accountability, there is a risk of perpetuating biases or enabling harmful applications.</p>



<p>OpenAI’s investment in Duke’s research marks at step toward understanding the role of AI in ethical decision-making. However, the journey is far from over. Developers and policymakers must work together to ensure that AI tools align with social values, and emphasise fairness and inclusivity while addressing biases and unintended consequences.</p>



<p>As AI becomes more integral to decision-making, its ethical implications demand attention. Projects like “Making Moral AI” offer a starting point for navigating a complex landscape, balancing innovation with responsibility in order to shape a future where technology serves the greater good.</p>

<p>The emerging US-China Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) rivalry could face a major policy transformation, as the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/2024_Comprehensive_List_of_Recommendations.pdf">recommends</a> a Manhattan Project-style initiative and restrictions on humanoid robots in its latest report to Congress.</p>



<p>Released in November 2024, the Commission&#8217;s <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/2024_Annual_Report_to_Congress.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual report</a> outlined <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/2024_Executive_Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">32 recommendations</a> that could fundamentally alter how the two countries interact, with artificial intelligence taking centre stage in a new chapter of strategic rivalry.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">US-China: the AGI moonshot and critical tech controls</h3>



<p>At the heart of the report lies an ambitious proposal: establishing a government-backed programme to develop AGI &#8211; AI systems that could match and potentially exceed human cognitive abilities. </p>



<p>However, the recommendation is just one piece of a larger technological puzzle, including export controls, investment screening, and new trade policies to preserve US technological advantages. </p>



<p>The proposed AGI initiative would provide multi-year contracts to leading AI companies, cloud providers, and data centre operators. It would be backed by the Defense Department&#8217;s highest priority, &#8220;DX Rating&#8221; &#8211; a designation typically reserved for critical national security projects. </p>



<p>This level of government involvement in AI development mirrors the urgency seen in previous technological races. It raises crucial questions about the role of state intervention in an industry primarily driven by private sector innovation.</p>



<p>The Commission&#8217;s tech-focused recommendations extend beyond AI. Notable proposals include restricting imports of Chinese-made autonomous humanoid robots with advanced dexterity, locomotion, and intelligence capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report also targets energy infrastructure products with remote monitoring capabilities, reflecting growing concerns about connected technologies in critical infrastructure. The report builds on existing export controls in the semiconductor space by recommending stronger oversight of technology transfers and investment flows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This comes as China continues to build domestic chip-making capabilities despite international restrictions. The Commission suggests creating an Outbound Investment Office that prevents US capital and expertise from advancing China&#8217;s technological capabilities in sensitive sectors.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reshaping trade relations and investment flows</h3>



<p>Perhaps most significantly, the report recommends eliminating China&#8217;s Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status—a move that could reshape the technology supply chain and trade flows that have defined the global tech industry for decades. This recommendation acknowledges how deeply intertwined the US and Chinese tech ecosystems have become, while suggesting that this interdependence may now pose more risks than benefits.</p>



<p>Data transparency is another key theme, with recommendations for expanded reporting requirements on investments and technology transfers. The Commission calls for better tracking of investments flowing through offshore entities, addressing a significant blind-spot in current oversight mechanisms.</p>



<p>The report&#8217;s release comes at a critical juncture in technological development. China&#8217;s push for self-sufficiency in vital technologies and its &#8220;new quality productive forces&#8221; initiative demonstrates Beijing&#8217;s determination to lead in next-generation technologies. Meanwhile, AI capabilities and quantum computing breakthroughs have raised the stakes in technology competition.</p>



<p>However, the Commission&#8217;s recommendations face practical challenges. Achieving AGI remains a complex scientific challenge that may not yield quick results, regardless of funding levels. Additionally, restrictions on technology transfers and investment could have unintended consequences for global innovation networks that have historically benefited both nations.</p>



<p>If these recommendations are implemented, the tech industry may need to navigate an increasingly complex regulatory landscape. Companies would face new compliance requirements for international investments, technology transfers, and collaborative research projects.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges and future implications</h3>



<p>The effectiveness of the proposed measures will likely depend on coordination with allies and partners who share similar technological capabilities and concerns. The report acknowledges this by recommending multilateral approaches to export controls and investment screening.</p>



<p>US-China technological competition has entered a new phase where government policy may play a more direct role in shaping development. Whether this approach accelerates or hinders innovation remains to be seen, but the tech industry should prepare for increased scrutiny and regulation of international technological collaboration.</p>

<p>When devices, networks, and AI work together seamlessly, it creates a smarter, more connected ecosystem.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t a distant dream; it&#8217;s a reality rapidly emerging as blockchain, IoT, and AI come together. These technologies are no longer working in isolation – they form a trio that redefines how industries could function.</p>



<p>David Palmer, chief product officer of Pairpoint by Vodafone, captures this shift: “Blockchain is providing trust. It gave us tokenisation, it gave us smart contracts, and it gave us a new way of automating, which is now spilling over into the wider business landscape.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org5c0797e">Building trust with blockchain</h3>



<p>At its core, blockchain has matured from experimental concepts to practical tools for industries. Its early potential is now manifest in real-world applications like supply chain management and decentralised finance (DeFi). Blockchain not only ensures trust through transparency but lets organisations streamline operations and gain new efficiencies.</p>



<p>Palmer described blockchain&#8217;s evolution: “It&#8217;s been years in the past where we&#8217;ve done a lot of proof of concepts, we&#8217;ve done a lot of training. It&#8217;s been a lot of headlines. But today I really want to explore how blockchain and IoT and AI can work together to really be a part of the new business digital infrastructure that&#8217;s emerging.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="orgc99eded">IoT&#8217;s expanding role in data generation</h3>



<p>IoT devices have become omnipresent, embedded in everything from cars and drones to household sensors. Experts expect that by 2030, there will be around 30 billion IoT devices worldwide. These devices generate massive amounts of data, which AI systems capitalise on to provide actionable insights. According to Palmer, “By 2030, we&#8217;re expecting over 30 billion IoT devices. These are cars, drones, cabinets, sensors, all woven into the business process and business industry.”</p>



<p>But IoT isn&#8217;t just about data collection. It introduces the concept of the “economy of things,” where devices transact autonomously. To make this work, however, these devices need secure and reliable connectivity – a role blockchain is uniquely equipped to fulfil.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org9374375">AI&#8217;s appetite for reliable data</h3>



<p>AI thrives on data, but the quality and security of that data are paramount. Public datasets have reached their limits, pushing businesses to tap into proprietary data generated by IoT devices. This creates a two-way relationship: IoT devices supply data for AI, while AI enhances these devices with real-time intelligence.</p>



<p>Palmer emphasises the importance of data trustworthiness in this ecosystem: “You need an identity which gives you origin of data. So we know the data is coming from a certain source, is signed, but then we also need to trust the AI that&#8217;s coming back.”</p>



<p>Blockchain plays an impartant role in ensuring trust. It guarantees the legitimacy of both the data given to AI systems and the intelligence delivered back to IoT devices through verified digital identities and cryptographic signing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="orgd93a44f">Digital wallets and the adoption of blockchain</h3>



<p>Digital wallets are becoming a cornerstone of this evolving ecosystem. Their global numbers are expected to grow from 4 billion today to 5.6 billion by 2030. Unlike traditional wallets, blockchain-enabled wallets go beyond cryptocurrencies, supporting functionalities like account abstraction and integration with tools like WalletConnect.</p>



<p>One breakthrough is the integration of tokenised bank deposits. These bridge traditional banking with blockchain, encouraging businesses to use blockchain for their transaction needs. As a result, blockchain is making its way into broader business applications.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org9594b76">Finance meets IoT</h3>



<p>The integration of finance into IoT devices is another forward step. Using smart contracts and AI, devices as disparate as cars and drones can now handle payments autonomously. Toll payments, EV charging, and retail purchases are just the beginning of this embedded finance ecosystem.</p>



<p>Palmer illustrated the potential: “By linking EV chargers and vehicles to blockchain, you can then relate that to their payment credential and their payment preferences. And then you can have a peer-to-peer transaction.”</p>



<p>The same principle applies to energy grids, where vehicles can sell energy during peak times and recharge during off-peak hours, thereby enhancing sustainability.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org333fe0d">Decentralised infrastructure networks</h3>



<p>Another interesting development is the rise of decentralised physical infrastructure networks (DePIN). These networks allow shared or tokenised resources to create community-driven infrastructures. For instance, protocols like Render pool GPU resources for gaming, while Filecoin decentralises storage.</p>



<p>According to Palmer, “It&#8217;s about how communities can build specific AI and specific connectivity infrastructure, specific payments infrastructure for their businesses.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="orge26512d">Blockchain and the role of CBDCs</h3>



<p>Governments are also noting blockchain&#8217;s potential. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are being explored as a way to integrate blockchain into macroeconomic policies, such as managing money supply and redistributing income. Tokenised deposits further extend blockchain&#8217;s role by digitising traditional monetary systems.</p>



<p>With CBDCs and tokenised deposits, blockchain is moving beyond niche applications to become an important part of financial ecosystems worldwide.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="orgb76c455">The metaverse and its evolution</h3>



<p>The metaverse, once a far-off concept, is rapidly evolving. Innovations like AI-enabled smart glasses change how users interact with immersive digital content. Palmer noted: “This year, the introduction of the glasses by Meta […] allow you to […] access your content but also have access to AI agents.”</p>



<p>AI robots are also adding a new dimension to the metaverse by bridging virtual and physical experiences. These same technologies and methods open up opportunities in a variety of industries, including manufacturing and healthcare.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org7073b77">A seamless digital ecosystem</h3>



<p>The convergence of blockchain, IoT, and AI marks a turning point in digital transformation. Blockchain ensures trust, IoT generates data, and AI delivers intelligence. Together, these technologies promise to create a digital operating system capable of reshaping industries and economies by 2030.</p>



<p>Palmer concludes, “If we can link billions of devices to blockchain and AI through secure infrastructure, we unlock the potential of a truly interconnected digital economy.”</p>

<p>As we approach a new year filled with potential, the landscape of technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), is on the brink of significant transformation. Manish Jethwa, CTO at Ordnance Survey (OS), the national mapping agency for Great Britain, offers an insightful glimpse into what we can expect from these advancements and their implications for the geospatial sector.</p>



<p><strong>Breaking Down Barriers with AI</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="512" height="489" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16778" style="width:314px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394.jpg 512w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-300x287.jpg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-209x200.jpg 209w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-298x285.jpg 298w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-262x250.jpg 262w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-100x96.jpg 100w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-60x57.jpg 60w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure></div>


<p>Looking ahead, Jethwa anticipates continued significant advancements in AI and machine learning, particularly with the push towards Gen AI. According to him, the integration of large language models (LLMs) with more sophisticated agents will not only perform complex tasks on behalf of users but also further reduce barriers to interaction. This shift, especially in the geospatial field, means that translating natural language into precise data queries will become more seamless, ultimately making geospatial datasets more accessible, mainstream, and user-friendly.</p>



<p><strong>Training for Complex Tasks</strong></p>



<p>Beyond LLMs, Jethwa is optimistic about progress in the broader category of machine learning, driven by greater access to graphics processing units for training.</p>



<p>He says: “At Ordnance Survey (OS), we’ll leverage this capability to train models for specific, complex tasks such as automatic feature extraction from imagery.</p>



<p>“With an increasing volume of data generated automatically, hopefully next year will also bring innovative tools and techniques to validate data, ensuring it can be confidently utilised for its intended use.”</p>



<p>He underscores the importance of not only pursuing new capabilities but also ensuring that these tools are integrated responsibly into workflows, focusing on quality and risk management.</p>



<p><strong>The Ethical Frontier</strong></p>



<p>The rapid evolution of AI brings with it an urgent need for ethical considerations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jethwa explains: “I would like to see a greater emphasis on ethical AI and responsible technology development,&#8221; including creating AI systems that are “transparent, fair, and unbiased” while also considering their environmental and societal impact.</p>



<p>This focus on ethics is encapsulated in OS’s Responsible AI Charter, which guides their approach to integrating new techniques safely.</p>



<p>Moreover, Jethwa highlights the role of workforce development in successful transformations. He believes organisations must commit to “retraining and upskilling employees to prepare them for the impact of AI and digital transformation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is vital to ensure that in the pursuit of enhanced efficiency, companies do not “lose the personality, creativity, and emotion that we bring as humans into the workplace.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Embracing Change While Managing Risks</strong></p>



<p>Despite the promise of technological advancements, obstacles remain in the journey toward digital transformation. Jethwa notes that challenges such as “cultural resistance and rapid successive changes leading to change fatigue will likely persist.” </p>



<p>He advocates for a careful balance between adopting new technologies and addressing the human elements of transformation processes.</p>



<p>As AI continues to influence various aspects of business, from decision-making to risk management, the issue of cybersecurity also looms large. Jethwa points out that “cybersecurity threats being powered by AI are becoming more sophisticated,” urging companies to develop comprehensive strategies that cover everything from data storage to analysis documentation.</p>



<p><strong>The Imperative to Progress</strong></p>



<p>In an evolving landscape, organisations that stagnate risk falling behind their competitors. Jethwa explains: “Companies that fail to keep up open themselves up to risks, such as changing customer expectations as well as attracting and retaining talent.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also emphasises the need for a “clear vision of future goals, effective communication of progress, and celebrating milestones to sustain momentum” in digital transformation initiatives.</p>



<p>As we move into a new year filled with promise, the future of AI and geospatial technology holds transformative power &#8211; but it must be used responsibly. The path that lies ahead in 2025 requires vigilance, an unwavering commitment to ethical practices and a human touch in order to drive successful innovation.</p>

<p>AI News caught up with Nerijus Šveistys, Senior Legal Counsel at <a href="https://oxylabs.io/">Oxylabs</a>, to understand the state of play when it comes to AI regulation and its potential implications for industries, businesses, and innovation.</p>



<p>“The boom of the last few years appears to have sparked a push to establish regulatory frameworks for AI governance,” explains Šveistys.</p>



<p>“This is a natural development, as the rise of AI seems to pose issues in data privacy and protection, bias and discrimination, safety, intellectual property, and other legal areas, as well as ethics that need to be addressed.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Regions diverge in regulatory strategy</h3>



<p>The European Union’s <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/eu-ai-act-early-prep-could-give-businesses-competitive-edge/">AI Act</a> has, unsurprisingly, positioned the region with a strict, centralised approach. The regulation, which came into force this year, is set to be fully effective by 2026.</p>



<p>Šveistys pointed out that the EU has acted relatively swiftly compared to other jurisdictions: “The main difference we can see is the comparative quickness with which the EU has released a uniform regulation to govern the use of all types of AI.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, other regions have opted for more piecemeal approaches. China, for instance, has been implementing regulations specific to certain AI technologies in a phased-out manner. According to Šveistys, China began regulating AI models as early as 2021.</p>



<p>“In 2021, they introduced regulation on recommendation algorithms, which [had] increased their capabilities in digital advertising. It was followed by regulations <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/chinas-deepfake-laws-come-into-effect-today/">on deep synthesis models</a> or, in common terms, deepfakes and content generation in 2022,” he said.</p>



<p>“Then, in 2023, regulation on generative AI models was introduced as these models were making a splash in commercial usage.”</p>



<p>The US, in contrast, remains relatively uncoordinated in its approach. Federal-level regulations are yet to be enacted, with efforts mostly emerging at the state level.</p>



<p>“There are proposed regulations at the state level, such as the so-called California AI Act, but even if they come into power, it may still take some time before they do,” Šveistys noted.</p>



<p>This delay in implementing unified AI regulations in the US has raised questions about the extent to which business pushback may be contributing to the slow rollout. Šveistys said that while lobbyist pressure is a known factor, it’s not the only potential reason.</p>



<p>“There was <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/tech-industry-giants-urge-eu-streamline-ai-regulations/">pushback to the EU AI Act</a>, too, which was nevertheless introduced. Thus, it is not clear whether the delay in the US is only due to lobbyism or other obstacles in the legislation enactment process,” explains Šveistys.</p>



<p>“It might also be because some still see AI as a futuristic concern, not fully appreciating the extent to which it is already a legal issue of today.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Balancing innovation and safety</h3>



<p>Differentiated regulatory approaches could affect the pace of innovation and business competitiveness across regions.</p>



<p>Europe’s regulatory framework, though more stringent, aims to ensure consumer protection and ethical adherence—something that less-regulated environments may lack.</p>



<p>“More rigid regulatory frameworks may impose compliance costs for businesses in the AI field and stifle competitiveness and innovation. On the other hand, they bring the benefits of protecting consumers and adhering to certain ethical norms,” comments Šveistys.</p>



<p>This trade-off is especially pronounced in AI-related sectors such as targeted advertising, where algorithmic bias is increasingly scrutinised.</p>



<p>AI governance often extends beyond laws that specifically target AI, incorporating related legal areas like those governing data collection and privacy. For example, the EU AI Act also regulates the use of AI in physical devices, such as elevators.</p>



<p>&#8220;Additionally, all businesses that collect data for advertisement are potentially affected as AI regulation can also cover algorithmic bias in targeted advertising,&#8221; emphasises Šveistys.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Impact on related industries</h3>



<p>One industry that is deeply intertwined with AI developments is web scraping. Typically used for collecting publicly available data, web scraping is undergoing an AI-driven evolution.</p>



<p>&#8220;From data collection, validation, analysis, or overcoming anti-scraping measures, there is a lot of potential for AI to massively improve the efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability of web scraping operations,&#8221; said Šveistys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as AI regulation and related laws tighten, web scraping companies will face greater scrutiny.</p>



<p>“AI regulations may also bring the spotlight on certain areas of law that were always very relevant to the web scraping industry, such as privacy or copyright laws,” Šveistys added.</p>



<p>“At the end of the day, scraping content protected by such laws without proper authorisation could always lead to legal issues, and now so can using AI this way.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Copyright battles and legal precedents</h3>



<p>The implications of AI regulation are also playing out on a broader legal stage, particularly in cases involving generative AI tools.</p>



<p>High-profile <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/openai-and-microsoft-lawsuit-github-copilot/">lawsuits</a> have been launched against AI giants like OpenAI and its primary backer, Microsoft, by authors, artists, and musicians who claim their copyrighted materials were used to train AI systems without proper permission.</p>



<p>“These cases are pivotal in determining the legal boundaries of using copyrighted material for AI development and establishing legal precedents for protecting intellectual property in the digital age,” said Šveistys.</p>



<p>While these lawsuits could take years to resolve, their outcomes may fundamentally shape the future of AI development. So, what can businesses do now as the regulatory and legal landscape continues to evolve?</p>



<p>“Speaking about the specific cases of using copyrighted material for AI training, businesses should approach this the same way as any web-scraping activity – that is, evaluate the specific data they wish to collect with the help of a legal expert in the field,” recommends Šveistys.</p>



<p>“It is important to recognise that the AI legal landscape is very new and rapidly evolving, with not many precedents in place to refer to as of yet. Hence, continuous monitoring and adaptation of your AI usage are crucial.”</p>



<p>Just this week, the UK Government made headlines with its announcement of a consultation on the use of copyrighted material for training AI models. Under the proposals, tech firms could be permitted to use copyrighted material unless owners have specifically opted out.</p>



<p>Despite the diversity of approaches globally, the AI regulatory push marks a significant moment for technological governance. Whether through the EU’s comprehensive model, China’s step-by-step strategy, or narrower, state-level initiatives like in the US, businesses worldwide must navigate a complex, evolving framework.</p>



<p>The challenge ahead will be striking the right balance between fostering innovation and mitigating risks, ensuring that AI remains a force for good while avoiding potential harms.</p>

<p>In a world where artificial intelligence is becoming omnipresent, it&#8217;s fascinating to think about the prospect of AI-powered robots and digital avatars that can experience emotions, similar to humans.</p>



<p>AI models lack consciousness and they don&#8217;t have the capacity to feel emotions, but what possibilities might arise if that were to change?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The birth of emotional AI</h3>



<p>The prospect of an AI system embracing those first sparks of emotion is perhaps not as far-fetched as one might think. Already, AI systems have some ability to<a href="https://www.inverse.com/science/how-good-is-ai-at-detecting-human-emotions-too-good"> gauge people&#8217;s emotions</a>, and increasingly they&#8217;re also able to<a href="https://www.justthink.ai/blog/emotional-intelligence-in-ai-chat-the-next-frontier"> replicate those feelings</a> in their interactions with humans.</p>



<p>It still requires a leap of faith to imagine an AI that could <em>feel</em> genuine emotions, but if it ever becomes possible, we&#8217;d imagine that they&#8217;ll be somewhat basic at first, similar to those of a child. Perhaps, an AI system might be able to feel joy at successfully completing a task, or maybe even confusion when presented with a challenge it doesn&#8217;t know how to solve. From there, it&#8217;s not difficult to envision that feeling of confusion evolving to one of frustration at its repeated failures to tackle the problem in question. And as this system evolves further, perhaps its emotional spectrum might expand to even feel a tinge of sadness or regret.</p>



<p>Should AI ever be able to feel such emotions, it wouldn&#8217;t be long before they could express more nuanced feelings, like excitement, impatience, and empathy for humans and other AIs. For instance, in a scenario where an AI system acquires a new skill or solves a new kind of problem, it might be able to experience a degree of satisfaction in success. This is similar to how humans feel when they solve a particularly taxing challenge, like a complex jigsaw puzzle, or when they do something for the first time, like driving a car.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Empathy as a motivator</h3>



<p>As AI&#8217;s ability to feel emotion evolves, it would become increasingly complex, progressing to a stage where it can even feel empathy for others. Empathy is one of the most complex human emotions, involving understanding and sharing the feelings of someone else.</p>



<p>If AI can experience such feelings, they may inspire it to become more helpful, similar to how humans are sometimes motivated to help someone less fortunate.</p>



<p>An AI that&#8217;s designed to assist human doctors might feel sad for someone who is afflicted by a mysterious illness. The feelings might push it to try harder to find a diagnosis for the rare disease that person is suffering from. If it gets it right, the AI might feel an overwhelming sense of accomplishment at doing so, knowing that the afflicted patient will be able to receive the treatment they need.</p>



<p>Or we can consider an AI system that&#8217;s built to detect changes to an environment. If such a system were to recognise a substantial increase in pollution in a certain area, it might feel disappointed or even saddened by such a discovery. But like with humans, the feelings might also inspire the AI to find ways to prevent this new source of pollution, perhaps by inventing a more efficient way to recycle or dispose of the toxic substance responsible.</p>



<p>In a similar way, an AI system that encounters numerous errors in a dataset might be compelled to refine its algorithm to reduce the number of errors.</p>



<p>This would also have a direct impact on human-to-AI interactions. It&#8217;s not hard to imagine that an AI-powered customer service bot that feels empathy for a customer might be willing to go the extra mile to help resolve that person&#8217;s problem. Or alternatively, we might get AI teachers with a better understanding of their students&#8217; emotions, which can then adapt teaching methods appropriately.</p>



<p>Empathetic AI could transform the way we treat people with mental health issues. The<a href="https://aicompetence.org/ai-for-mental-health-chatbots-digital-therapists/"> concept of a digital therapist</a> is not new, but if a digital therapist can better relate to their patients on an emotional level, it can figure out how best to support them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is this even possible?</h3>



<p>Surprisingly, we may not be that far off. AI systems like<a href="https://antix.in"> Antix</a> are already capable of expressing artificial empathy. It&#8217;s a platform for creating digital humans that are programmed to respond sympathetically when they recognise feelings of frustration, anger or upset in the people they interact with. Its digital humans can detect people&#8217;s emotions based on their speech, the kinds of words they use, intonation, and body language.</p>



<p>The ability of Antix&#8217;s digital humans to understand emotion is partly based on the way they are trained. Each digital human is a unique<a href="https://token.antix.in"> non-fungible token or NFT</a> that learns over time from its users, gaining more knowledge and evolving so it can adapt its interactions in response to an individual&#8217;s behaviour or preferences.</p>



<p>Because digital humans can recognise emotions and replicate them, they have the potential to deliver more profound and meaningful experiences. Antix utilises the Unreal Engine 5 platform to give its creations a more realistic appearance. Creators can alter almost every aspect of their digital humans, including the voice and appearance, with the ability to edit skin tone, eye colour, and small details like eyebrows and facial hair.</p>



<p>What sets Antix apart from other AI platforms is that users can customise the behaviour of their digital humans, to provide the most appropriate emotional response in different scenarios. Thus, digital humans can respond with an appropriate tone of voice, making the right gestures and expressions when they&#8217;re required to feel sad, for example, before transforming in an instant to express excitement, happiness, or joy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AI is getting real</h3>



<p>Emotional AI systems are a work in progress, and the result will be digital humans that feel more lifelike in any scenario where they can be useful.</p>



<p>The CEO of Zoom has talked about the emergence of AI-powered digital twins that can<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24168733/zoom-ceo-ai-clones-digital-twins-videoconferencing-decoder-interview"> participate in video calls</a> on their user&#8217;s behalf, allowing the user to be in two places at once, so to speak. If the digital human version of your boss can express empathy, satisfaction, excitement and anger, the concept would be more effective, fostering a more realistic connection, even if the real boss isn&#8217;t present in their physical form.</p>



<p>A customer service-focused digital human that&#8217;s able to empathise with callers will likely have a tremendous impact on customer satisfaction, and a sympathetic digital teacher might find ways to elicit more positive responses from its students, accelerating the speed at which they learn.</p>



<p>With digital humans capable of expressing emotions, the potential for more realistic, lifelike, and immersive experiences is almost limitless, and it will result in more rewarding and beneficial interactions with AI systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The initiative is part of the government’s broader strategy to embrace technology to improve outcomes, echoing commitments outlined in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/missions">&#8220;Plan for Change&#8221;</a> to modernise public services and drive economic growth through innovative solutions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The power of AI for modernisation</h3>



<p>Among the published records, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office is leveraging AI to provide faster responses to Britons seeking assistance overseas. Similarly, the Ministry of Justice is utilising algorithms to help researchers gain a deeper understanding of how individuals interact with the justice system, while other departments are deploying AI to enhance job advertisements.</p>



<p>The ATRS aims to document how such algorithmic tools are utilised and ensure their responsible application. By doing so, the government hopes to strengthen public trust in these innovations while encouraging their continued adoption across sectors.</p>



<p>Speaking on the government’s approach, Science Secretary Peter Kyle remarked:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;Technology has huge potential to transform public services for the better; we will put it to use to cut backlogs, save money, and improve outcomes for citizens across the country.</em></p>



<p><em>Transparency in how and why the public sector is using algorithmic tools is crucial to ensure that they are trusted and effective. That is why we will continue to take bold steps like releasing these records to make sure everyone is clear on how we are applying and trialling technology as we use it to bring public services back from the brink.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Specifically, the Department for Business and Trade has highlighted its algorithmic tool designed to predict which companies are likely to export goods internationally.</p>



<p>The AI-driven approach allows officials to target support towards high-growth potential businesses, enabling them to reach global markets faster. Previously reliant on time-consuming manual methods to analyse the more than five million companies registered on Companies House, this advancement ensures better allocation of resources and expedited assistance.</p>



<p>Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;Our Plan for Change will deliver economic growth, and for that to succeed, we need to support companies across the UK to realise their full potential when it comes to exporting around the globe.</em></p>



<p><em>Our use of AI plays a vital and growing role in that mission, allowing high-growth businesses to maximise the export opportunities available to them, while ensuring that we are using taxpayers’ money responsibly and efficiently in delivering economic stability.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing clear guidelines for AI in public services</h3>



<p>To bolster public trust, new guidelines have been announced to clarify the scope of algorithmic transparency records.</p>



<p>Central government organisations will need to publish a record for any algorithmic tool that interacts directly with citizens or plays a significant role in decision-making about individuals. Limited exceptions, such as those concerning national security, apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These records will be published once tools are piloted publicly or have become operational. They will detail the data used to train AI models, the underlying technologies, and the measures implemented to mitigate risks.</p>



<p>Importantly, the records also seek to confirm that – while AI tools are used to accelerate decision-making processes – human oversight remains integral, with trained staff responsible for final decisions.</p>



<p>Dr Antonio Espingardeiro, a member of <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a> and an expert in software and robotics, commented:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;AI has the potential to radically transform the public sector. In recent years, we have seen AI become a credible part of everyday public services. As it becomes more sophisticated, AI can conduct data-heavy tasks traditionally undertaken by humans. It can analyse vast quantities of information and, when coupled with machine learning, search through records and infer patterns or anomalies in data that would otherwise take decades for humans to analyse.</em></p>



<p><em>With this announcement, the UK government has acknowledged AI’s potential and proven that technology investment is essential to improving outcomes and the delivery of vital services. Over time, machine learning and generative AI (GenAI) could bring substantial value to the public system. With increased adoption, we will soon be able to deliver the scalability that the public sector needs and relieve the pressures and workloads placed on staff.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eleanor Watson, also a member of IEEE and an AI ethics engineer affiliated with <a href="https://www.su.org/">Singularity University</a>, added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;With AI growing more rapidly than ever before, and already being tested and employed in education, healthcare, transportation, finance, data security, and more, the government, tech leaders, and academia should work together to establish standards and regulations for safe and responsible development of AI-based systems. This way, AI can be used to its full potential as indicated with this latest announcement.</em></p>



<p><em>Data privacy is probably the most critical ethical consideration, requiring informed consent, data anonymisation, strict access controls, secure storage, and compliance. New techniques such as homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, federated learning, and part-trained models can help models to make use of our personal data in an encrypted form.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Transparency remains a key tenet of the UK Government’s AI strategy. This announcement follows a recent statement by Pat McFadden, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who affirmed that the benefits of technology – particularly AI – must span both public and private sectors and be used to modernise government.</p>



<p>As the Science Secretary’s department solidifies government efforts to create a &#8220;digital centre,&#8221; it marks a major step forward in boosting the responsible and effective use of AI across the UK’s public sector.</p>



<p>The ATRS records offer a valuable template for how governments worldwide can deploy AI systems to maximise efficiency, grow transparency, and balance the need for innovation with ethical considerations.</p>

<p>Amazon has announced <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/amazon-partners-anthropic-enhance-alexa/">an additional</a> $4 billion investment in Anthropic, bringing the company&#8217;s total commitment to $8 billion, part of its expanding artificial intelligence strategy. The investment was <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-invests-additional-4-billion-anthropic-ai">announced</a> on November 22, 2024 and strengthens Amazon&#8217;s position in the AI sector, building on its established cloud computing services in the form of AWS. </p>



<p>While maintaining Amazon&#8217;s minority stake in Anthropic, the investment represents a significant development in the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/anthropic-urges-ai-regulation-avoid-catastrophes/">approach to AI technology</a> and cloud infrastructure. The expanded collaboration goes beyond mere financial investment. Anthropic has now designated AWS as its &#8220;primary training partner&#8221; for AI model development, in addition to Amazon&#8217;s role as a primary cloud provider. </p>



<p>Amazon&#8217;s investment will see Anthropic utilizing AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips for training and on which to deploy its future foundational models, including any updates to the flagship Claude AI system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AWS&#8217;s competitive edge</h3>



<p>The continuing partnership provides Amazon with several strategic advantages in the competitive cloud computing and AI services market:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Hardware innovation</strong>: The commitment to use AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips for Anthropic&#8217;s advanced AI models validates Amazon&#8217;s investment in custom AI chips and positions AWS as a serious competitor to NVIDIA in the AI infrastructure space.</li>



<li><strong>Cloud service enhancement</strong>: AWS customers will receive early access to fine-tuning capabilities for data processed by Anthropic models. This benefit alone could attract more enterprises to Amazon&#8217;s cloud platform.</li>



<li><strong>Model performance</strong>: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Anthropic&#8217;s <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/anthropic-new-claude-ai-models-and-computer-control/">latest model</a> available through Amazon Bedrock, has demonstrated exceptional performance in agentic coding tasks, according to Anthropic.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Amazon&#8217;s multi-faceted AI strategy</h3>



<p>While the increased investment in Anthropic is impressive in monetary terms, it represents just one component of Amazon&#8217;s broader AI strategy. The company appears to be pursuing a multi-pronged approach:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>External partnerships: </strong>The Anthropic investment provides immediate access to cutting-edge AI capabilities from third-parties.</li>



<li><strong>Internal development:</strong>&nbsp;Amazon continues to develop its own AI models and capabilities.</li>



<li><strong>Infrastructure development:</strong> Ongoing investment in AI-specific hardware like Trainium chips demonstrates a commitment to building AI-focussed infrastructure.</li>
</ol>



<p>The expanded partnership signals Amazon&#8217;s long-term commitment to AI development yet retains flexibility thanks to its minority stakeholding. This approach allows Amazon to benefit from Anthropic&#8217;s innovations while preserving the ability to pursue other partnerships with external AI companies and continue internal development initiatives.</p>



<p>The investment reinforces the growing trend where major tech companies seek strategic AI partnerships rather than relying solely on internal development. It also highlights the important role of cloud infrastructure in the AI industry&#8217;s growth. AWS has positioned itself as a suitable platform for AI model training and deployment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-gb/">CrowdStrike</a> commissioned a survey of 1,022 cybersecurity professionals worldwide to assess their views on generative AI (GenAI) adoption and its implications.</p>



<p>The findings reveal enthusiasm for GenAI’s potential to bolster defences against increasingly sophisticated threats, but also trepidation over risks such as data exposure and attacks on GenAI systems.</p>



<p>While much has been speculated about the transformative impact of GenAI, the survey’s results paint a clearer picture of how practitioners are thinking about its role in cybersecurity.</p>



<p>According to the report, “We’re entering the era of GenAI in cybersecurity.” However, as organisations adopt this promising technology, their success will hinge on ensuring the safe, responsible, and industry-specific deployment of GenAI tools.</p>



<p>CrowdStrike’s research reveals five pivotal findings that shape the current state of GenAI in cybersecurity:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Platform-based GenAI is favoured </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>80% of respondents indicated a preference for GenAI delivered through integrated cybersecurity platforms rather than standalone tools. Seamless integration is cited as a crucial factor, with many preferring tools that work cohesively with existing systems. “GenAI’s value is linked to how well it works within the broader technology ecosystem,” the report states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, almost two-thirds (63%) of those surveyed expressed willingness to switch security vendors to access GenAI capabilities from competitors. The survey underscores the industry’s readiness for unified platforms that streamline operations and reduce the complexity of adopting new point solutions.</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>GenAI built by cybersecurity experts is a must</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Security teams believe GenAI tools should be specifically designed for cybersecurity, not general-purpose systems. 83% of respondents reported they would not trust tools that provide “unsuitable or ill-advised security guidance.”</p>



<p>Breach prevention remains a key motivator, with 74% stating they had faced breaches within the past 18 months or were concerned about vulnerabilities. Respondents prioritised tools from vendors with proven expertise in cybersecurity, incident response, and threat intelligence over suppliers with broad AI leadership alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As CrowdStrike summarised, “The emphasis on breach prevention and vendor expertise suggests security teams would avoid domain-agnostic GenAI tools.”</p>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Augmentation, not replacement </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Despite growing fears of automation replacing jobs in many industries, the survey’s findings indicate minimal concerns about job displacement in cybersecurity. Instead, respondents expect GenAI to empower security analysts by automating repetitive tasks, reducing burnout, onboarding new personnel faster, and accelerating decision-making.</p>



<p>GenAI’s potential for augmenting analysts’ workflows was underscored by its most requested applications: threat intelligence analysis, assistance with investigations, and automated response mechanisms. As noted in the report, “Respondents overwhelmingly believe GenAI will ultimately optimise the analyst experience, not replace human labour.”</p>



<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>ROI outweighs cost concerns  </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>For organisations evaluating GenAI investments, measurable return on investment (ROI) is the paramount concern, ahead of licensing costs or pricing model confusion. Respondents expect platform-led GenAI deployments to deliver faster results, thanks to cost savings from reduced tool management burdens, streamlined training, and fewer security incidents.</p>



<p>According to the survey data, the expected ROI breakdown includes 31% from cost optimisation and more efficient tools, 30% from fewer incidents, and 26% from reduced management time. Security leaders are clearly focused on ensuring the financial justification for GenAI investments.</p>



<ol start="5" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Guardrails and safety are crucial </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>GenAI adoption is tempered by concerns around safety and privacy, with 87% of organisations either implementing or planning new security policies to oversee GenAI use. Key risks include exposing sensitive data to large language models (LLMs) and adversarial attacks on GenAI tools. Respondents rank safety and privacy controls among their most desired GenAI features, highlighting the need for responsible implementation.</p>



<p>Reflecting the cautious optimism of practitioners, only 39% of respondents firmly believed that the rewards of GenAI outweigh its risks. Meanwhile, 40% considered the risks and rewards “comparable.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Current state of GenAI adoption in cybersecurity</h3>



<p>GenAI adoption remains in its early stages, but interest is growing. 64% of respondents are actively researching or have already invested in GenAI tools, and 69% of those currently evaluating their options plan to make a purchase within the year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Security teams are primarily driven by three concerns: improving attack detection and response, enhancing operational efficiency, and mitigating the impact of staff shortages. Among economic considerations, the top priority is ROI – a sign that security leaders are keen to demonstrate tangible benefits to justify their spending.</p>



<p>CrowdStrike emphasises the importance of a platform-based approach, where GenAI is integrated into a unified system. Such platforms enable seamless adoption, measurable benefits, and safety guardrails for responsible usage. According to the report, “The future of GenAI in cybersecurity will be defined by tools that not only advance security but also uphold the highest standards of safety and privacy.”</p>



<p>The CrowdStrike survey concludes by affirming that “GenAI is not a silver bullet” but has tremendous potential to improve cybersecurity outcomes. As organisations evaluate its adoption, they will prioritise tools that integrate seamlessly with existing platforms, deliver faster response times, and ensure safety and privacy compliance.</p>



<p>With threats becoming more sophisticated, the role of GenAI in enabling security teams to work faster and smarter could prove indispensable. While still in its infancy, GenAI in cybersecurity is poised to shift from early adoption to mainstream deployment, provided organisations and vendors address its risks responsibly.</p>
