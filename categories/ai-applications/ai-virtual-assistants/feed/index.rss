										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai has announced the launch of Gemini 2.0, a model that represents the next step in Google’s ambition to revolutionise AI.</p>



<p>A year after introducing the Gemini 1.0 model, this major upgrade incorporates enhanced multimodal capabilities, agentic functionality, and innovative user tools designed to push boundaries in AI-driven technology.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Leap towards transformational AI&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Reflecting on Google’s 26-year mission to organise and make the world’s information accessible, Pichai remarked, “If Gemini 1.0 was about organising and understanding information, Gemini 2.0 is about making it much more useful.”</p>



<p>Gemini 1.0, released in December 2022, was notable for being Google’s first natively multimodal AI model. The first iteration excelled at understanding and processing text, video, images, audio, and code. Its enhanced 1.5 version became widely embraced by developers for its long-context understanding, enabling applications such as the productivity-focused NotebookLM.</p>



<p>Now, with Gemini 2.0, Google aims to accelerate the role of AI as a universal assistant capable of native image and audio generation, better reasoning and planning, and real-world decision-making capabilities. In Pichai&#8217;s words, the development represents the dawn of an “agentic era.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Introducing Gemini 2.0 | Our most capable AI model yet" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fs0t6SdODd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>“We have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision,” Pichai explained.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gemini 2.0: Core features and availability</h3>



<p>At the heart of today&#8217;s announcement is the experimental release of Gemini 2.0 Flash, the flagship model of Gemini’s second generation. It builds upon the foundations laid by its predecessors while delivering faster response times and advanced performance.</p>



<p>Gemini 2.0 Flash supports multimodal inputs and outputs, including the ability to generate native images in conjunction with text and produce steerable text-to-speech multilingual audio. Additionally, users can benefit from native tool integration such as Google Search and even third-party user-defined functions.</p>



<p>Developers and businesses will gain access to Gemini 2.0 Flash via the Gemini API in <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/">Google AI Studio</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai">Vertex AI</a>, while larger model sizes are scheduled for broader release in January 2024.</p>



<p>For global accessibility, the Gemini app now features a chat-optimised version of the 2.0 Flash experimental model. Early adopters can experience this updated assistant on desktop and mobile, with a mobile app rollout imminent.</p>



<p>Products such as Google Search are also being enhanced with Gemini 2.0, unlocking the ability to handle complex queries like advanced math problems, coding enquiries, and multimodal questions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Comprehensive suite of AI innovations&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The launch of Gemini 2.0 comes with compelling new tools that showcase its capabilities.</p>



<p>One such feature, Deep Research, functions as an AI research assistant, simplifying the process of investigating complex topics by compiling information into comprehensive reports. Another upgrade enhances Search with Gemini-enabled AI Overviews that tackle intricate, multi-step user queries.</p>



<p>The model was trained using Google’s sixth-generation Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), known as Trillium, which Pichai notes “powered 100% of Gemini 2.0 training and inference.”</p>



<p>Trillium is now <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/trillium-tpu-is-ga">available</a> for external developers, allowing them to benefit from the same infrastructure that supports Google’s own advancements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pioneering agentic experiences&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Accompanying Gemini 2.0 are experimental “agentic” prototypes built to explore the future of human-AI collaboration, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Project Astra: A universal AI assistant</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>First introduced at I/O earlier this year, Project Astra taps into Gemini 2.0’s multimodal understanding to improve real-world AI interactions. Trusted testers have trialled the assistant on Android, offering feedback that has helped refine its multilingual dialogue, memory retention, and integration with Google tools like Search, Lens, and Maps. Astra has also demonstrated near-human conversational latency, with further research underway for its application in wearable technology, such as prototype AI glasses.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Project Mariner: Redefining web automation </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Project Mariner is an experimental web-browsing assistant that uses Gemini 2.0’s ability to reason across text, images, and interactive elements like forms within a browser. In initial tests, it achieved an 83.5% success rate on the WebVoyager benchmark for completing end-to-end web tasks. Early testers using a Chrome extension are helping to refine Mariner’s capabilities while Google evaluates safety measures that ensure the technology remains user-friendly and secure.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Jules: A coding agent for developers  </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Jules, an AI-powered assistant built for developers, integrates directly into GitHub workflows to address coding challenges. It can autonomously propose solutions, generate plans, and execute code-based tasks—all under human supervision. This experimental endeavour is part of Google’s long-term goal to create versatile AI agents across various domains.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Gaming applications and beyond  </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Extending Gemini 2.0’s reach into virtual environments, Google DeepMind is working with gaming partners like Supercell on intelligent game agents. These experimental AI companions can interpret game actions in real-time, suggest strategies, and even access broader knowledge via Search. Research is also being conducted into how Gemini 2.0’s spatial reasoning could support robotics, opening doors for physical-world applications in the future.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Project Astra | Exploring the future capabilities of a universal AI assistant" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hIIlJt8JERI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Addressing responsibility in AI development</h3>



<p>As AI capabilities expand, Google emphasises the importance of prioritising safety and ethical considerations.</p>



<p>Google claims Gemini 2.0 underwent extensive risk assessments, bolstered by the Responsibility and Safety Committee’s oversight to mitigate potential risks. Additionally, its embedded reasoning abilities allow for <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/openai-enhances-ai-safety-new-red-teaming-methods/">advanced “red-teaming,”</a> enabling developers to evaluate security scenarios and optimise safety measures at scale.</p>



<p>Google is also exploring safeguards to address user privacy, prevent misuse, and ensure AI agents remain reliable. For instance, Project Mariner is designed to prioritise user instructions while resisting malicious prompt injections, preventing threats like phishing or fraudulent transactions. Meanwhile, privacy controls in Project Astra make it easy for users to manage session data and deletion preferences.</p>



<p>Pichai reaffirmed the company’s commitment to responsible development, stating, “We firmly believe that the only way to build AI is to be responsible from the start.”</p>



<p>With the Gemini 2.0 Flash release, Google is edging closer to its vision of building a universal assistant capable of transforming interactions across domains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Salesforce has unveiled the findings of its <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/uk/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/12/Salesforce-UK-AI-Readiness-Index.pdf">UK AI Readiness Index</a>, signalling the nation is in a position to spearhead the next wave of AI innovation, also known as agentic AI.</p>



<p>The report places the UK ahead of its G7 counterparts in terms of AI adoption but also underscores areas ripe for improvement, such as support for SMEs, fostering cross-sector partnerships, and investing in talent development.</p>



<p>Zahra Bahrololoumi CBE, UKI CEO at Salesforce, commented: “Agentic AI is revolutionising enterprise software by enabling humans and agents to collaborate seamlessly and drive customer success.</p>



<p>“The UK AI Readiness Index positively highlights that the UK has both the vision and infrastructure to be a powerhouse globally in AI, and lead the current third wave of agentic AI.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">UK AI adoption sets the stage for agentic revolution</h3>



<p>The Index details how both the public and private sectors in the UK have embraced AI&#8217;s transformative potential. With a readiness score of 65.5, surpassing the G7 average of 61.2, the UK is establishing itself as a hub for large-scale AI projects, driven by a robust innovation culture and pragmatic regulatory approaches.</p>



<p>The government has played its part in maintaining a stable and secure environment for tech investment. Initiatives such as the <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/uk-reveals-ai-safety-summit-opening-day-agenda/">AI Safety Summit</a> at Bletchley Park and risk-oriented AI legislation showcase Britain&#8217;s leadership on critical AI issues like transparency and privacy.</p>



<p>Business readiness is equally impressive, with UK industries scoring 52, well above the G7 average of 47.8. SMEs in the UK are increasingly prioritising AI adoption, further bolstering the nation&#8217;s stance in the international AI arena.</p>



<p>Adam Evans, EVP &amp; GM of Salesforce AI Platform, is optimistic about the evolution of agentic AI. Evans foresees that, by 2025, these agents will become business-aware—expertly navigating industry-specific challenges to execute meaningful tasks and decisions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Investments fuelling AI growth</h3>



<p>Salesforce is committing $4 billion to the UK’s AI ecosystem over the next five years. Since establishing its UK AI Centre in London, Salesforce says it has engaged over 3,000 stakeholders in AI training and workshops.</p>



<p>Key investment focuses include creating a regulatory bridge between the EU’s <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/balancing-innovation-trust-experts-assess-eu-ai-act/">rules-based approach</a> and the more relaxed US approach, and ensuring SMEs have the resources to integrate AI. A strong emphasis also lies on enhancing digital skills and centralising training to support the AI workforce of the future.</p>



<p>Feryal Clark, Minister for AI and Digital Government, said: &#8220;These findings are further proof the UK is in prime position to take advantage of AI, and highlight our strength in spurring innovation, investment, and collaboration across the public and private sector.</p>



<p>“There is a global race for AI and we’ll be setting out plans for how the UK can use the technology to ramp-up adoption across the economy, kickstart growth, and build an AI sector which can scale and compete on the global stage.”</p>



<p>Antony Walker, Deputy CEO at techUK, added: “To build this progress, government and industry must collaborate to foster innovation, support SMEs, invest in skills, and ensure flexible regulation, cementing the UK’s leadership in the global AI economy.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Agentic AI boosting UK business productivity&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Capita, Secret Escapes, Heathrow, and Bionic are among the organisations that have adopted Salesforce’s Agentforce to boost their productivity.</p>



<p>Adolfo Hernandez, CEO of Capita, said: &#8220;We want to transform Capita’s recruitment process into a fast, seamless and autonomous experience that benefits candidates, our people, and our clients.</p>



<p>“With autonomous agents providing 24/7 support, our goal is to enable candidates to complete the entire recruitment journey within days as opposed to what has historically taken weeks.</p>



<p>Secret Escapes, a curator of luxury travel deals, finds autonomous agents crucial for personalising services to its 60 million European members.</p>



<p>Kate Donaghy, Head of Business Technology at Secret Escapes, added: “Agentforce uses our unified data to automate routine tasks like processing cancellations, updating booking information, or even answering common travel questions about luggage, flight information, and much more—freeing up our customer service agents to handle more complex and last-minute travel needs to better serve our members.”</p>



<p>The UK’s AI readiness is testament to the synergy between government, business, and academia. To maintain its leadership, the UK must sustain its focus on collaboration, skills development, and innovation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The research – conducted by <a href="https://www.mhp.com/">MHP</a> – surveyed 4,700 car drivers across China, the US, Germany, the UK, Italy, Sweden, and Poland, revealing significant geographical disparities in AI acceptance and understanding.</p>



<p>According to the study, while AI is becoming integral to modern vehicles, European consumers remain hesitant about its implementation and value proposition.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Regional disparities</h3>



<p>The study found that 48 percent of Chinese respondents view in-car AI predominantly as an opportunity, while merely 23 percent of European respondents share this optimistic outlook. In Europe, 39 percent believe AI&#8217;s opportunities and risks are broadly balanced, while 24 percent take a negative stance, suggesting the risks outweigh potential benefits.</p>



<p>Understanding of AI technology also varies significantly by region. While over 80 percent of Chinese respondents claim to understand AI&#8217;s use in cars, this figure drops to just 54 percent among European drivers, highlighting a notable knowledge gap.</p>



<p>Marcus Willand, Partner at MHP and one of the study&#8217;s authors, notes: &#8220;The figures show that the prospect of greater safety and comfort due to AI can motivate purchasing decisions. However, the European respondents in particular are often hesitant and price-sensitive.&#8221;</p>



<p>The willingness to pay for AI features shows an equally stark divide. Just 23 percent of European drivers expressed willingness to pay for AI functions, compared to 39 percent of Chinese drivers. The study suggests that most users now expect AI features to be standard rather than optional extras.</p>

<p>Dr Nils Schaupensteiner, Associated Partner at MHP and study co-author, said: &#8220;Automotive companies need to create innovations with clear added value and develop both direct and indirect monetisation of their AI offerings, for example through data-based business models and improved services.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In-vehicle AI opportunities</h3>



<p>Despite these challenges, traditional automotive manufacturers maintain a trust advantage over tech giants. The study reveals that 64 percent of customers trust established car manufacturers with AI implementation, compared to 50 percent for technology firms like Apple, Google, and Microsoft.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="746" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-1024x746.jpg" alt="Graph highlighting the public trust in various stakeholders regarding in-vehicle AI." class="wp-image-16439" srcset="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-1024x746.jpg 1024w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-300x219.jpg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-768x560.jpg 768w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-1536x1119.jpg 1536w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-274x200.jpg 274w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-380x277.jpg 380w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-343x250.jpg 343w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-100x73.jpg 100w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-60x44.jpg 60w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust.jpg 1821w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The research identified several key areas where AI could provide significant value across the automotive industry&#8217;s value chain, including pattern recognition for quality management, enhanced data management capabilities, AI-driven decision-making systems, and improved customer service through AI-powered communication tools.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is worth OEMs and suppliers considering the opportunities offered by the new technology along their entire value chain,&#8221; explains Augustin Friedel, Senior Manager and study co-author. &#8220;However, the possible uses are diverse and implementation is quite complex.&#8221;</p>



<p>The study reveals that <a href="https://iottechnews.com/news/nearly-80-percent-us-motorists-ai-voice-assistants/">while up to 79 percent</a> of respondents express interest in AI-powered features such as driver assistance systems, intelligent route planning, and predictive maintenance, manufacturers face significant challenges in monetising these capabilities, particularly in the European market.</p>

<p>In a fireside chat at <a href="https://s2024.siggraph.org/">SIGGRAPH 2024</a>, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang and Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared their insights on the potential of open source AI and virtual assistants.</p>



<p>The conversation began with Zuckerberg announcing the launch of <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/create-your-own-custom-ai-with-ai-studio/">AI Studio</a>, a new platform designed to democratise AI creation. This tool allows users to create, share, and discover AI characters, potentially opening up AI development to millions of creators and small businesses.</p>



<p>Huang emphasised the ubiquity of AI in the future, stating, &#8220;Every single restaurant, every single website will probably, in the future, have these AIs …&#8221;</p>



<p>Zuckerberg concurred, adding, &#8220;…just like every business has an email address and a website and a social media account, I think, in the future, every business is going to have an AI.&#8221;</p>



<p>This vision aligns with NVIDIA&#8217;s recent developments showcased at SIGGRAPH. The company previewed &#8220;James,&#8221; an interactive digital human based on the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA ACE</a> (Avatar Cloud Engine) reference design. <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/digital-humans-siggraph-2024/">James</a> – a virtual assistant capable of providing contextually accurate responses – demonstrates the potential for businesses to create custom, hyperrealistic avatars for customer interactions.</p>



<p>The discussion highlighted Meta&#8217;s significant contributions to AI development. Huang praised Meta&#8217;s work, saying, &#8220;You guys have done amazing AI work,&#8221; and cited advancements in computer vision, language models, and real-time translation. He also acknowledged the widespread use of <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>, an open-source machine learning framework developed by Meta.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="AI and The Next Computing Platforms With Jensen Huang and Mark Zuckerberg" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-cmMcMZoZ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Both CEOs stressed the importance of open source in advancing AI. Meta has positioned itself as a leader in this field, implementing AI across its platforms and releasing open-source models like <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/meta-advances-open-source-ai-frontier-level-llama-3-1/">Llama 3.1</a>. This latest model, with 405 billion parameters, required training on over 16,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, representing a substantial investment in resources.</p>



<p>Zuckerberg shared his vision for more integrated AI models, saying, &#8220;I kind of dream of one day like you can almost imagine all of Facebook or Instagram being like a single AI model that has unified all these different content types and systems together.&#8221; He believes that collaboration is crucial for further advancements in AI.</p>



<p>The conversation touched on the potential of AI to enhance human productivity. Huang described a future where AI could generate images in real-time as users type, allowing for fluid collaboration between humans and AI assistants. This concept is reflected in NVIDIA&#8217;s latest advancements to the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/maxine">NVIDIA Maxine AI</a> platform, including Maxine 3D and Audio2Face-2D, which aim to create immersive telepresence experiences.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Zuckerberg expressed enthusiasm about combining AI with augmented reality eyewear, mentioning Meta&#8217;s collaboration with eyewear maker Luxottica. He envisions this technology transforming education, entertainment, and work.</p>



<p>Huang discussed the evolution of AI interactions, moving beyond turn-based conversations to more complex, multi-option simulations. &#8220;Today&#8217;s AI is kind of turn-based. You say something, it says something back to you,&#8221; Huang explained. &#8220;In the future, AI could contemplate multiple options, or come up with a tree of options and simulate outcomes, making it much more powerful.&#8221;</p>



<p>The importance of this evolution is evident in the adoption of NVIDIA&#8217;s technologies by companies across industries. HTC, Looking Glass, Reply, and UneeQ are among the latest firms using NVIDIA ACE and Maxine for applications ranging from customer service agents to telepresence experiences in entertainment, retail, and hospitality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The success of Chinese AI education applications like Question.AI and Gauth in the US market comes at a time of fierce competition within China, where over 200 large language models—critical for generative AI services like ChatGPT—have been developed. As of March, more than half of these received approval from Chinese authorities for public release.</p>



<p>Faced with a <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/2021/10/15/globaldata-china-is-ahead-of-global-rivals-for-ai-unicorns/">saturated domestic market</a>, more Chinese app developers are now setting their sights on Western markets, including the US.</p>



<p>The <em><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3267561/china-developed-ai-apps-gain-foothold-us-helping-kids-do-their-homework" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South China Morning Post</a></em> reported that Chinese AI apps have swiftly gained traction in the US, particularly in the education sector. Applications like Question.AI, owned by Beijing-based educational technology startup Zuoyebang and ByteDance&#8217;s Gauth, are revolutionising how American students tackle their homework by providing instant solutions and explanations through advanced AI algorithms. </p>



<p>For context, Question.AI and Gauth are popular educational apps that use generative AI to help US students in various subjects. Users can photograph homework problems to receive solutions with step-by-step explanations. Question.AI launched in mid-2023, while Gauth (originally Gauthmath) started in 2020 as a math solver before expanding. Both offer free essential use with paid additional features. As of recent rankings, Gauth is the second most popular educational app globally, with Question.AI at seventh.</p>



<p>This convenience has resonated with students and parents, offering a seamless blend of technology and education that complements the increasingly digital learning environment. Initially designed for China&#8217;s vast and competitive market, these apps began bringing cutting-edge AI capabilities to American classrooms. After all, with its high digital adoption rates and openness to educational innovation, the US market presents a lucrative opportunity for Chinese developers looking to expand their user base beyond domestic borders.</p>



<p>According to mobile app intelligence service AppMagic, Question.AI and Gauth, generative AI-driven homework helpers, were ranked among the top three free educational apps in the US on Apple&#8217;s iOS store and Google Play from February to May.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AI in education: Domestic pressure driving global expansion&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In China, the development of large language models has been prolific. With over 200 such models created, the competition among AI developers is intense. This high-stakes environment has driven many companies to seek growth opportunities abroad. The approval of these models for public release by Chinese authorities signifies the maturity and readiness of these technologies for broader application, encouraging developers to explore international markets.</p>



<p>This push for global expansion is not just about finding new revenue streams but also about gaining a competitive edge and establishing a global presence. For Chinese AI companies, breaking into Western markets, particularly the US, symbolises commercial success and technological leadership on a global scale.</p>



<p>The adoption of Chinese AI apps <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/2019/11/01/abi-research-usa-reclaims-top-china-ai-investments/">in the US</a> education sector also illustrates some strategic advantages these tools possess. The sophisticated AI technology in Question.AI and Gauth delivers individual-learnt experiences. In the US, educators appreciate such granularity as they are committed to personalised instruction for students with various learning styles.</p>



<p>Moreover, the flexibility and accessibility of these AI tools align well with the digital transformation sweeping through American education. Given that the pandemic has expedited online learning, AI-powered educational apps stand to bridge this gap in traditional teaching methodologies by providing timely help and improving their delivery methods.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Navigating challenges: Data privacy and cultural integration</h3>



<p>Even with their technological prowess, Chinese AI apps will be met by data privacy and security concerns when entering US markets. There will be increased oversight on how these apps manage user data, especially in light of the geopolitical tensions between the US and China. Ensuring compliance with stringent US data privacy regulations is crucial for gaining user trust and widespread acceptance.</p>



<p>Additionally, cultural integration poses another hurdle. Chinese educational philosophies often emphasise rote learning and discipline, which may contrast with American education&#8217;s focus on creativity and critical thinking. Successfully blending these approaches to create a holistic learning experience will be essential to the sustained success of these apps in the US.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the success of Chinese AI apps like Question.AI and Gauth in the US clearly demonstrates the advanced technological capabilities that have been developed through intense domestic competition. As these companies continue to navigate the complexities of entering the Western market, their impact on the future of education is expected to expand.</p>

<p><a href="https://group.softbank/en">SoftBank</a> founder and CEO Masayoshi Son has claimed that artificial super intelligence (ASI) could be a reality within the next decade.</p>



<p>Speaking at SoftBank&#8217;s annual meeting in Tokyo on June 21, Son painted a picture of a future where AI far surpasses human intelligence, potentially revolutionising life as we know it. Son asserted that by 2030, AI could be &#8220;one to 10 times smarter than humans,&#8221; and by 2035, it might reach a staggering &#8220;10,000 times smarter&#8221; than human intelligence.</p>



<p>SoftBank’s CEO made a clear distinction between artificial general intelligence (AGI) and ASI. According to Son, AGI would be equivalent to a human &#8220;genius,&#8221; potentially up to 10 times more capable than an average person. ASI, however, would be in a league of its own, with capabilities 10,000 times beyond human potential.</p>



<p>Son&#8217;s predictions align with the goals of <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/2024/06/20/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskevers-startup-aims-safe-superintelligence/">Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI)</a>, founded by Ilya Sutskever, former chief scientist at OpenAI, along with Daniel Levy and Daniel Gross. SSI&#8217;s mission, as stated on their website, is to &#8220;approach safety and capabilities in tandem, as technical problems to be solved through revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs.&#8221;</p>



<p>The timing of these announcements underscores the growing focus on superintelligent AI within the tech industry. While SoftBank appears to be prioritising the development of ASI, SSI is emphasising the importance of safety in this pursuit. As stated by SSI&#8217;s founders, &#8220;We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the scientific community has yet to reach a consensus on the feasibility or capabilities of AGI or ASI. Current AI systems, while impressive in specific domains, are still far from achieving human-level reasoning across all areas.</p>



<p>Son&#8217;s speech took an unexpectedly personal turn when he linked the development of ASI to his own sense of purpose and mortality. &#8220;SoftBank was founded for what purpose? For what purpose was Masayoshi Son born? It may sound strange, but I think I was born to realise ASI. I am super serious about it,&#8221; he declared.</p>



<p>Son&#8217;s predictions and SoftBank&#8217;s apparent pivot towards ASI development, coupled with the formation of SSI, raise important questions about the future of AI and its potential impact on society. While the promise of superintelligent AI is enticing, it also brings concerns about job displacement, ethical considerations, and the potential risks associated with creating an intelligence that far surpasses our own.</p>



<p>Whether Son&#8217;s vision of ASI within a decade proves prescient or overly optimistic remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the race towards superintelligent AI is heating up, with major players positioning themselves at the forefront.</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s newly-announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">partnership</a> with OpenAI – which brings ChatGPT capabilities to iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia – comes without any direct money exchange.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-12/apple-to-pay-openai-for-chatgpt-through-distribution-not-cash">Bloomberg</a> report by Mark Gurman, &#8220;Apple isn&#8217;t paying OpenAI as part of the partnership.&#8221;</p>



<p>Instead, the Cupertino-based company is leveraging its massive user base and device ecosystem as currency.</p>



<p>&#8220;Apple believes pushing OpenAI&#8217;s brand and technology to hundreds of millions of its devices is of equal or greater value than monetary payments,&#8221; Gurman’s sources explained.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: Apple and OpenAI have been silent on the financial terms of their ChatGPT deal. But here are the details: Apple and OpenAI aren’t paying each other and instead there’s money to be made later on revenue sharing deals. More here: <a href="https://t.co/MGTdWeJsyG">https://t.co/MGTdWeJsyG</a></p>&mdash; Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1801042506001387988?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Gurman notes that OpenAI could find a silver lining by encouraging Apple users to subscribe to ChatGPT Plus, priced at $20 per month. If subscribers sign up through Apple devices, the iPhone maker will likely even claim a commission.</p>



<p>Apple&#8217;s AI strategy extends beyond OpenAI. The company is reportedly in talks to offer Google&#8217;s Gemini chatbot as an additional option later this year, signalling its intent to provide users with diverse AI experiences without necessarily having to make such major investments itself.</p>

<p>The long-term vision for Apple involves capturing a slice of the revenue generated from monetising chatbot results on its operating systems. This move anticipates a shift in user behaviour, with more people relying on AI assistants rather than traditional search engines like Google.</p>



<p>While Apple&#8217;s AI plans are ambitious, challenges remain. The report highlights that the company has yet to secure a deal with a local Chinese provider for chatbot features, though discussions with local firms like Baidu and Alibaba are underway. Initially, Apple Intelligence will be limited to US English, with expanded language support planned for the following year.</p>



<p>The Apple-OpenAI deal represents a novel approach to collaboration in the AI space, where brand exposure and technological integration are valued as much as, if not more than, direct financial compensation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> has released a platform that allows users to interact with popular AI chatbots privately, ensuring that their data remains secure and protected.</p>



<p>The service, accessible at <a href="http://duck.ai">Duck.ai</a>, is globally available and features a light and clean user interface. Users can choose from four AI models: two closed-source models and two open-source models. The closed-source models are OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-3.5 Turbo and Anthropic&#8217;s Claude 3 Haiku, while the open-source models are Meta&#8217;s Llama-3 70B and Mistral AI&#8217;s Mixtral 8x7b.</p>



<p>What sets DuckDuckGo AI Chat apart is its commitment to user privacy. Neither DuckDuckGo nor the chatbot providers can use user data to train their models, ensuring that interactions remain private and anonymous. DuckDuckGo also strips away metadata, such as server or IP addresses, so that queries appear to originate from the company itself rather than individual users.</p>



<p>The company has agreements in place with all model providers to ensure that any saved chats are completely deleted within 30 days, and that none of the chats made on the platform can be used to train or improve the models. This makes preserving privacy easier than changing the privacy settings for each service.</p>



<p>In an era where online services are increasingly hungry for user data, DuckDuckGo&#8217;s AI Chat service is a breath of fresh air. The company&#8217;s commitment to privacy is a direct response to the growing concerns about data collection and usage in the AI industry. By providing a private and anonymous platform for users to interact with AI chatbots, DuckDuckGo is setting a new standard for the industry.</p>



<p>DuckDuckGo&#8217;s AI service is free to use within a daily limit, and the company is considering launching a paid tier to reduce or eliminate these limits. The service is designed to be a complementary partner to its search engine, allowing users to switch between search and AI chat for a more comprehensive search experience.</p>



<p>&#8220;We view AI Chat and search as two different but powerful tools to help you find what you&#8217;re looking for – especially when you&#8217;re exploring a new topic. You might be shopping or doing research for a project and are unsure how to get started. In situations like these, either AI Chat or Search could be good starting points.&#8221; the company explained.</p>



<p>“If you start by asking a few questions in AI Chat, the answers may inspire traditional searches to track down reviews, prices, or other primary sources. If you start with Search, you may want to switch to AI Chat for follow-up queries to help make sense of what you’ve read, or for quick, direct answers to new questions that weren’t covered in the web pages you saw.”</p>



<p>To accommodate that user workflow, DuckDuckGo has made AI Chat accessible through DuckDuckGo Private Search for quick access.</p>



<p>The launch of DuckDuckGo AI Chat comes at a time when the AI industry is facing increasing scrutiny over data privacy and usage. The service is a welcome addition for privacy-conscious individuals, joining the recent launch of <a href="https://venice.ai/">Venice AI</a> by crypto entrepreneur Erik Voorhees. Venice AI features an uncensored AI chatbot and image generator that doesn&#8217;t require accounts and doesn&#8217;t retain data..</p>



<p>As the AI industry continues to evolve, it&#8217;s clear that privacy will remain a top concern for users. With the launch of DuckDuckGo AI Chat, the company is taking a significant step towards providing users with a private and secure platform for interacting with AI chatbots.</p>

<p>Google has <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-update-flash-ai-assistant-io-2024/">unveiled</a> a series of updates to its AI offerings, including the introduction of Gemini 1.5 Flash, enhancements to Gemini 1.5 Pro, and progress on Project Astra, its vision for the future of AI assistants.</p>



<p>Gemini 1.5 Flash is a new addition to Google&#8217;s family of models, designed to be faster and more efficient to serve at scale. While lighter-weight than the 1.5 Pro, it retains the ability for multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and features the breakthrough long context window of one million tokens.</p>



<p>&#8220;1.5 Flash excels at summarisation, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more,&#8221; explained Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind. “This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called ‘distillation,’ where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Google has significantly improved the capabilities of its Gemini 1.5 Pro model, extending its context window to a groundbreaking two million tokens. Enhancements have been made to its code generation, logical reasoning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding capabilities.</p>



<p>The company has also integrated Gemini 1.5 Pro into Google products, including the Gemini Advanced and Workspace apps. Additionally, Gemini Nano now understands multimodal inputs, expanding beyond text-only to include images.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Google announced its next generation of open models, Gemma 2, designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency. The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, the company&#8217;s first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3.</p>



<p>Finally, Google shared progress on Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent), its vision for the future of AI assistants. The company has developed prototype agents that can process information faster, understand context better, and respond quickly in conversation.</p>



<p>“We’ve always wanted to build a universal agent that will be useful in everyday life. Project Astra, shows multimodal understanding and real-time conversational capabilities,” explained Google CEO Sundar Pichai.</p>



<p>&#8220;With technology like this, it&#8217;s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses.&#8221;</p>
