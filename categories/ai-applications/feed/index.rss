										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The emerging US-China Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) rivalry could face a major policy transformation, as the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/2024_Comprehensive_List_of_Recommendations.pdf">recommends</a> a Manhattan Project-style initiative and restrictions on humanoid robots in its latest report to Congress.</p>



<p>Released in November 2024, the Commission&#8217;s <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/2024_Annual_Report_to_Congress.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual report</a> outlined <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/2024_Executive_Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">32 recommendations</a> that could fundamentally alter how the two countries interact, with artificial intelligence taking centre stage in a new chapter of strategic rivalry.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">US-China: the AGI moonshot and critical tech controls</h3>



<p>At the heart of the report lies an ambitious proposal: establishing a government-backed programme to develop AGI &#8211; AI systems that could match and potentially exceed human cognitive abilities. </p>



<p>However, the recommendation is just one piece of a larger technological puzzle, including export controls, investment screening, and new trade policies to preserve US technological advantages. </p>



<p>The proposed AGI initiative would provide multi-year contracts to leading AI companies, cloud providers, and data centre operators. It would be backed by the Defense Department&#8217;s highest priority, &#8220;DX Rating&#8221; &#8211; a designation typically reserved for critical national security projects. </p>



<p>This level of government involvement in AI development mirrors the urgency seen in previous technological races. It raises crucial questions about the role of state intervention in an industry primarily driven by private sector innovation.</p>



<p>The Commission&#8217;s tech-focused recommendations extend beyond AI. Notable proposals include restricting imports of Chinese-made autonomous humanoid robots with advanced dexterity, locomotion, and intelligence capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report also targets energy infrastructure products with remote monitoring capabilities, reflecting growing concerns about connected technologies in critical infrastructure. The report builds on existing export controls in the semiconductor space by recommending stronger oversight of technology transfers and investment flows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This comes as China continues to build domestic chip-making capabilities despite international restrictions. The Commission suggests creating an Outbound Investment Office that prevents US capital and expertise from advancing China&#8217;s technological capabilities in sensitive sectors.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reshaping trade relations and investment flows</h3>



<p>Perhaps most significantly, the report recommends eliminating China&#8217;s Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status—a move that could reshape the technology supply chain and trade flows that have defined the global tech industry for decades. This recommendation acknowledges how deeply intertwined the US and Chinese tech ecosystems have become, while suggesting that this interdependence may now pose more risks than benefits.</p>



<p>Data transparency is another key theme, with recommendations for expanded reporting requirements on investments and technology transfers. The Commission calls for better tracking of investments flowing through offshore entities, addressing a significant blind-spot in current oversight mechanisms.</p>



<p>The report&#8217;s release comes at a critical juncture in technological development. China&#8217;s push for self-sufficiency in vital technologies and its &#8220;new quality productive forces&#8221; initiative demonstrates Beijing&#8217;s determination to lead in next-generation technologies. Meanwhile, AI capabilities and quantum computing breakthroughs have raised the stakes in technology competition.</p>



<p>However, the Commission&#8217;s recommendations face practical challenges. Achieving AGI remains a complex scientific challenge that may not yield quick results, regardless of funding levels. Additionally, restrictions on technology transfers and investment could have unintended consequences for global innovation networks that have historically benefited both nations.</p>



<p>If these recommendations are implemented, the tech industry may need to navigate an increasingly complex regulatory landscape. Companies would face new compliance requirements for international investments, technology transfers, and collaborative research projects.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges and future implications</h3>



<p>The effectiveness of the proposed measures will likely depend on coordination with allies and partners who share similar technological capabilities and concerns. The report acknowledges this by recommending multilateral approaches to export controls and investment screening.</p>



<p>US-China technological competition has entered a new phase where government policy may play a more direct role in shaping development. Whether this approach accelerates or hinders innovation remains to be seen, but the tech industry should prepare for increased scrutiny and regulation of international technological collaboration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The UK Government wants to prove that AI is being deployed responsibly within public services to speed up decision-making, reduce backlogs, and enhance support for citizens.</p>



<p>New records, part of the Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard (ATRS), were <a href="https://www.gov.uk/algorithmic-transparency-records">published</a> this week to shed light on the AI tools being used and set a benchmark for transparency and accountability in the integration of technology in public service delivery.</p>



<p>The initiative is part of the government’s broader strategy to embrace technology to improve outcomes, echoing commitments outlined in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/missions">&#8220;Plan for Change&#8221;</a> to modernise public services and drive economic growth through innovative solutions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The power of AI for modernisation</h3>



<p>Among the published records, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office is leveraging AI to provide faster responses to Britons seeking assistance overseas. Similarly, the Ministry of Justice is utilising algorithms to help researchers gain a deeper understanding of how individuals interact with the justice system, while other departments are deploying AI to enhance job advertisements.</p>



<p>The ATRS aims to document how such algorithmic tools are utilised and ensure their responsible application. By doing so, the government hopes to strengthen public trust in these innovations while encouraging their continued adoption across sectors.</p>



<p>Speaking on the government’s approach, Science Secretary Peter Kyle remarked:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;Technology has huge potential to transform public services for the better; we will put it to use to cut backlogs, save money, and improve outcomes for citizens across the country.</em></p>



<p><em>Transparency in how and why the public sector is using algorithmic tools is crucial to ensure that they are trusted and effective. That is why we will continue to take bold steps like releasing these records to make sure everyone is clear on how we are applying and trialling technology as we use it to bring public services back from the brink.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Specifically, the Department for Business and Trade has highlighted its algorithmic tool designed to predict which companies are likely to export goods internationally.</p>



<p>The AI-driven approach allows officials to target support towards high-growth potential businesses, enabling them to reach global markets faster. Previously reliant on time-consuming manual methods to analyse the more than five million companies registered on Companies House, this advancement ensures better allocation of resources and expedited assistance.</p>



<p>Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;Our Plan for Change will deliver economic growth, and for that to succeed, we need to support companies across the UK to realise their full potential when it comes to exporting around the globe.</em></p>



<p><em>Our use of AI plays a vital and growing role in that mission, allowing high-growth businesses to maximise the export opportunities available to them, while ensuring that we are using taxpayers’ money responsibly and efficiently in delivering economic stability.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing clear guidelines for AI in public services</h3>



<p>To bolster public trust, new guidelines have been announced to clarify the scope of algorithmic transparency records.</p>



<p>Central government organisations will need to publish a record for any algorithmic tool that interacts directly with citizens or plays a significant role in decision-making about individuals. Limited exceptions, such as those concerning national security, apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These records will be published once tools are piloted publicly or have become operational. They will detail the data used to train AI models, the underlying technologies, and the measures implemented to mitigate risks.</p>



<p>Importantly, the records also seek to confirm that – while AI tools are used to accelerate decision-making processes – human oversight remains integral, with trained staff responsible for final decisions.</p>



<p>Dr Antonio Espingardeiro, a member of <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a> and an expert in software and robotics, commented:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;AI has the potential to radically transform the public sector. In recent years, we have seen AI become a credible part of everyday public services. As it becomes more sophisticated, AI can conduct data-heavy tasks traditionally undertaken by humans. It can analyse vast quantities of information and, when coupled with machine learning, search through records and infer patterns or anomalies in data that would otherwise take decades for humans to analyse.</em></p>



<p><em>With this announcement, the UK government has acknowledged AI’s potential and proven that technology investment is essential to improving outcomes and the delivery of vital services. Over time, machine learning and generative AI (GenAI) could bring substantial value to the public system. With increased adoption, we will soon be able to deliver the scalability that the public sector needs and relieve the pressures and workloads placed on staff.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eleanor Watson, also a member of IEEE and an AI ethics engineer affiliated with <a href="https://www.su.org/">Singularity University</a>, added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;With AI growing more rapidly than ever before, and already being tested and employed in education, healthcare, transportation, finance, data security, and more, the government, tech leaders, and academia should work together to establish standards and regulations for safe and responsible development of AI-based systems. This way, AI can be used to its full potential as indicated with this latest announcement.</em></p>



<p><em>Data privacy is probably the most critical ethical consideration, requiring informed consent, data anonymisation, strict access controls, secure storage, and compliance. New techniques such as homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, federated learning, and part-trained models can help models to make use of our personal data in an encrypted form.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Transparency remains a key tenet of the UK Government’s AI strategy. This announcement follows a recent statement by Pat McFadden, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who affirmed that the benefits of technology – particularly AI – must span both public and private sectors and be used to modernise government.</p>



<p>As the Science Secretary’s department solidifies government efforts to create a &#8220;digital centre,&#8221; it marks a major step forward in boosting the responsible and effective use of AI across the UK’s public sector.</p>



<p>The ATRS records offer a valuable template for how governments worldwide can deploy AI systems to maximise efficiency, grow transparency, and balance the need for innovation with ethical considerations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-gb/">CrowdStrike</a> commissioned a survey of 1,022 cybersecurity professionals worldwide to assess their views on generative AI (GenAI) adoption and its implications.</p>



<p>The findings reveal enthusiasm for GenAI’s potential to bolster defences against increasingly sophisticated threats, but also trepidation over risks such as data exposure and attacks on GenAI systems.</p>



<p>While much has been speculated about the transformative impact of GenAI, the survey’s results paint a clearer picture of how practitioners are thinking about its role in cybersecurity.</p>



<p>According to the report, “We’re entering the era of GenAI in cybersecurity.” However, as organisations adopt this promising technology, their success will hinge on ensuring the safe, responsible, and industry-specific deployment of GenAI tools.</p>



<p>CrowdStrike’s research reveals five pivotal findings that shape the current state of GenAI in cybersecurity:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Platform-based GenAI is favoured </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>80% of respondents indicated a preference for GenAI delivered through integrated cybersecurity platforms rather than standalone tools. Seamless integration is cited as a crucial factor, with many preferring tools that work cohesively with existing systems. “GenAI’s value is linked to how well it works within the broader technology ecosystem,” the report states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, almost two-thirds (63%) of those surveyed expressed willingness to switch security vendors to access GenAI capabilities from competitors. The survey underscores the industry’s readiness for unified platforms that streamline operations and reduce the complexity of adopting new point solutions.</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>GenAI built by cybersecurity experts is a must</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Security teams believe GenAI tools should be specifically designed for cybersecurity, not general-purpose systems. 83% of respondents reported they would not trust tools that provide “unsuitable or ill-advised security guidance.”</p>



<p>Breach prevention remains a key motivator, with 74% stating they had faced breaches within the past 18 months or were concerned about vulnerabilities. Respondents prioritised tools from vendors with proven expertise in cybersecurity, incident response, and threat intelligence over suppliers with broad AI leadership alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As CrowdStrike summarised, “The emphasis on breach prevention and vendor expertise suggests security teams would avoid domain-agnostic GenAI tools.”</p>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Augmentation, not replacement </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Despite growing fears of automation replacing jobs in many industries, the survey’s findings indicate minimal concerns about job displacement in cybersecurity. Instead, respondents expect GenAI to empower security analysts by automating repetitive tasks, reducing burnout, onboarding new personnel faster, and accelerating decision-making.</p>



<p>GenAI’s potential for augmenting analysts’ workflows was underscored by its most requested applications: threat intelligence analysis, assistance with investigations, and automated response mechanisms. As noted in the report, “Respondents overwhelmingly believe GenAI will ultimately optimise the analyst experience, not replace human labour.”</p>



<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>ROI outweighs cost concerns  </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>For organisations evaluating GenAI investments, measurable return on investment (ROI) is the paramount concern, ahead of licensing costs or pricing model confusion. Respondents expect platform-led GenAI deployments to deliver faster results, thanks to cost savings from reduced tool management burdens, streamlined training, and fewer security incidents.</p>



<p>According to the survey data, the expected ROI breakdown includes 31% from cost optimisation and more efficient tools, 30% from fewer incidents, and 26% from reduced management time. Security leaders are clearly focused on ensuring the financial justification for GenAI investments.</p>



<ol start="5" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Guardrails and safety are crucial </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>GenAI adoption is tempered by concerns around safety and privacy, with 87% of organisations either implementing or planning new security policies to oversee GenAI use. Key risks include exposing sensitive data to large language models (LLMs) and adversarial attacks on GenAI tools. Respondents rank safety and privacy controls among their most desired GenAI features, highlighting the need for responsible implementation.</p>



<p>Reflecting the cautious optimism of practitioners, only 39% of respondents firmly believed that the rewards of GenAI outweigh its risks. Meanwhile, 40% considered the risks and rewards “comparable.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Current state of GenAI adoption in cybersecurity</h3>



<p>GenAI adoption remains in its early stages, but interest is growing. 64% of respondents are actively researching or have already invested in GenAI tools, and 69% of those currently evaluating their options plan to make a purchase within the year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Security teams are primarily driven by three concerns: improving attack detection and response, enhancing operational efficiency, and mitigating the impact of staff shortages. Among economic considerations, the top priority is ROI – a sign that security leaders are keen to demonstrate tangible benefits to justify their spending.</p>



<p>CrowdStrike emphasises the importance of a platform-based approach, where GenAI is integrated into a unified system. Such platforms enable seamless adoption, measurable benefits, and safety guardrails for responsible usage. According to the report, “The future of GenAI in cybersecurity will be defined by tools that not only advance security but also uphold the highest standards of safety and privacy.”</p>



<p>The CrowdStrike survey concludes by affirming that “GenAI is not a silver bullet” but has tremendous potential to improve cybersecurity outcomes. As organisations evaluate its adoption, they will prioritise tools that integrate seamlessly with existing platforms, deliver faster response times, and ensure safety and privacy compliance.</p>



<p>With threats becoming more sophisticated, the role of GenAI in enabling security teams to work faster and smarter could prove indispensable. While still in its infancy, GenAI in cybersecurity is poised to shift from early adoption to mainstream deployment, provided organisations and vendors address its risks responsibly.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Leap towards transformational AI&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Reflecting on Google’s 26-year mission to organise and make the world’s information accessible, Pichai remarked, “If Gemini 1.0 was about organising and understanding information, Gemini 2.0 is about making it much more useful.”</p>



<p>Gemini 1.0, released in December 2022, was notable for being Google’s first natively multimodal AI model. The first iteration excelled at understanding and processing text, video, images, audio, and code. Its enhanced 1.5 version became widely embraced by developers for its long-context understanding, enabling applications such as the productivity-focused NotebookLM.</p>



<p>Now, with Gemini 2.0, Google aims to accelerate the role of AI as a universal assistant capable of native image and audio generation, better reasoning and planning, and real-world decision-making capabilities. In Pichai&#8217;s words, the development represents the dawn of an “agentic era.”</p>

</div></figure>



<p>“We have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision,” Pichai explained.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gemini 2.0: Core features and availability</h3>



<p>At the heart of today&#8217;s announcement is the experimental release of Gemini 2.0 Flash, the flagship model of Gemini’s second generation. It builds upon the foundations laid by its predecessors while delivering faster response times and advanced performance.</p>



<p>Gemini 2.0 Flash supports multimodal inputs and outputs, including the ability to generate native images in conjunction with text and produce steerable text-to-speech multilingual audio. Additionally, users can benefit from native tool integration such as Google Search and even third-party user-defined functions.</p>



<p>Developers and businesses will gain access to Gemini 2.0 Flash via the Gemini API in <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/">Google AI Studio</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai">Vertex AI</a>, while larger model sizes are scheduled for broader release in January 2024.</p>



<p>For global accessibility, the Gemini app now features a chat-optimised version of the 2.0 Flash experimental model. Early adopters can experience this updated assistant on desktop and mobile, with a mobile app rollout imminent.</p>



<p>Products such as Google Search are also being enhanced with Gemini 2.0, unlocking the ability to handle complex queries like advanced math problems, coding enquiries, and multimodal questions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Comprehensive suite of AI innovations&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The launch of Gemini 2.0 comes with compelling new tools that showcase its capabilities.</p>



<p>One such feature, Deep Research, functions as an AI research assistant, simplifying the process of investigating complex topics by compiling information into comprehensive reports. Another upgrade enhances Search with Gemini-enabled AI Overviews that tackle intricate, multi-step user queries.</p>



<p>The model was trained using Google’s sixth-generation Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), known as Trillium, which Pichai notes “powered 100% of Gemini 2.0 training and inference.”</p>



<p>Trillium is now <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/trillium-tpu-is-ga">available</a> for external developers, allowing them to benefit from the same infrastructure that supports Google’s own advancements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pioneering agentic experiences&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Accompanying Gemini 2.0 are experimental “agentic” prototypes built to explore the future of human-AI collaboration, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Project Astra: A universal AI assistant</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>First introduced at I/O earlier this year, Project Astra taps into Gemini 2.0’s multimodal understanding to improve real-world AI interactions. Trusted testers have trialled the assistant on Android, offering feedback that has helped refine its multilingual dialogue, memory retention, and integration with Google tools like Search, Lens, and Maps. Astra has also demonstrated near-human conversational latency, with further research underway for its application in wearable technology, such as prototype AI glasses.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Project Mariner: Redefining web automation </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Project Mariner is an experimental web-browsing assistant that uses Gemini 2.0’s ability to reason across text, images, and interactive elements like forms within a browser. In initial tests, it achieved an 83.5% success rate on the WebVoyager benchmark for completing end-to-end web tasks. Early testers using a Chrome extension are helping to refine Mariner’s capabilities while Google evaluates safety measures that ensure the technology remains user-friendly and secure.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Jules: A coding agent for developers  </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Jules, an AI-powered assistant built for developers, integrates directly into GitHub workflows to address coding challenges. It can autonomously propose solutions, generate plans, and execute code-based tasks—all under human supervision. This experimental endeavour is part of Google’s long-term goal to create versatile AI agents across various domains.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Gaming applications and beyond  </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Extending Gemini 2.0’s reach into virtual environments, Google DeepMind is working with gaming partners like Supercell on intelligent game agents. These experimental AI companions can interpret game actions in real-time, suggest strategies, and even access broader knowledge via Search. Research is also being conducted into how Gemini 2.0’s spatial reasoning could support robotics, opening doors for physical-world applications in the future.</p>

<p>There’s a new contender in the AI space that’s making waves: QwQ-32B-Preview. </p>



<p>This so-called “reasoning” AI model is being compared to OpenAI o1, and it’s one of the few you can download under a permissive license. For developers and researchers eager to experiment, that’s a significant bonus.</p>



<p>Built by Alibaba’s Qwen team, QwQ-32B-Preview is anything but lightweight. It packs 32.5 billion parameters—think of these as the building blocks of its problem-solving abilities—and can handle prompts of up to 32,000 words; longer than some novels! Tests show it outperforms OpenAI o1-preview and o1-mini on benchmarks like AIME and MATH. For context, AIME uses other AI models to assess performance, while MATH is a collection of  word problems.</p>



<p>But the model isn’t just about maths problems or logic puzzles. What sets it apart is how it approaches tasks. QwQ-32B-Preview plans ahead, fact-checks its work, and avoids common AI mistakes. Of course, it’s not flawless—Alibaba acknowledges issues like language switching, occasional loops, and difficulties with “common sense” reasoning. Even so, it represents a step toward more intelligent AI systems.</p>



<p>QwQ-32B-Preview is accessible: You can run or download it via Hugging Face. However, like other Chinese-developed AI, it operates within regulatory boundaries. That means it carefully avoids politically sensitive topics to comply with China’s rules, ensuring it aligns with “core socialist values.”</p>



<p>Alibaba isn’t alone in this space. Meta’s Llama 3.1 is another open-source option, though it takes a different approach by focusing on generative AI rather than reasoning. While both models are innovative, QwQ-32B-Preview specialises in problem-solving with what the company describes as a human-like approach, putting it in the reasoning category.</p>



<p>The competition in AI inside China is intensifying. Companies such as DeepSeek, Shanghai AI Lab, and Kunlun Tech have entered the reasoning AI race, releasing their models at pace. For example, DeepSeek’s r1 claims to outperform OpenAI’s o1 on half of its benchmark tests, particularly in maths and programming. Shanghai AI Lab’s InternThinker takes a structured approach to problem-solving, incorporating steps such as understanding queries, recalling knowledge, planning solutions, and reflecting on its answers.</p>



<p>This surge of activity highlights how quickly Chinese companies are catching up with US tech giants. Xu Liang, an AI entrepreneur from Hangzhou, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3289022/chinese-ai-firms-rush-out-costly-reasoning-models-take-openais-o1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summed it up</a>: “OpenAI gave the direction; with research, Chinese tech firms are making progress.” The release of QwQ-32B-Preview and its competitors shows how much ground they’re covering.</p>



<p>But this goes beyond just catching up. Reasoning AI marks a change in how models are designed and used. Unlike older AI systems that relied on brute force to generate answers, reasoning models like QwQ-32B-Preview aim to mimic human problem-solving. The approach not only makes them more effective for complex tasks but also expands their potential use cases, like tackling advanced maths or providing detailed financial advice.</p>



<p>Whether it’s solving puzzles, reasoning through intricate problems, or expanding what open-source AI can achieve, one thing is clear: the evolution of AI is accelerating. Buckle up—this is only the beginning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Salesforce has unveiled the findings of its <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/uk/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/12/Salesforce-UK-AI-Readiness-Index.pdf">UK AI Readiness Index</a>, signalling the nation is in a position to spearhead the next wave of AI innovation, also known as agentic AI.</p>



<p>The report places the UK ahead of its G7 counterparts in terms of AI adoption but also underscores areas ripe for improvement, such as support for SMEs, fostering cross-sector partnerships, and investing in talent development.</p>



<p>Zahra Bahrololoumi CBE, UKI CEO at Salesforce, commented: “Agentic AI is revolutionising enterprise software by enabling humans and agents to collaborate seamlessly and drive customer success.</p>



<p>“The UK AI Readiness Index positively highlights that the UK has both the vision and infrastructure to be a powerhouse globally in AI, and lead the current third wave of agentic AI.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">UK AI adoption sets the stage for agentic revolution</h3>



<p>The Index details how both the public and private sectors in the UK have embraced AI&#8217;s transformative potential. With a readiness score of 65.5, surpassing the G7 average of 61.2, the UK is establishing itself as a hub for large-scale AI projects, driven by a robust innovation culture and pragmatic regulatory approaches.</p>



<p>The government has played its part in maintaining a stable and secure environment for tech investment. Initiatives such as the <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/uk-reveals-ai-safety-summit-opening-day-agenda/">AI Safety Summit</a> at Bletchley Park and risk-oriented AI legislation showcase Britain&#8217;s leadership on critical AI issues like transparency and privacy.</p>



<p>Business readiness is equally impressive, with UK industries scoring 52, well above the G7 average of 47.8. SMEs in the UK are increasingly prioritising AI adoption, further bolstering the nation&#8217;s stance in the international AI arena.</p>



<p>Adam Evans, EVP &amp; GM of Salesforce AI Platform, is optimistic about the evolution of agentic AI. Evans foresees that, by 2025, these agents will become business-aware—expertly navigating industry-specific challenges to execute meaningful tasks and decisions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Investments fuelling AI growth</h3>



<p>Salesforce is committing $4 billion to the UK’s AI ecosystem over the next five years. Since establishing its UK AI Centre in London, Salesforce says it has engaged over 3,000 stakeholders in AI training and workshops.</p>



<p>Key investment focuses include creating a regulatory bridge between the EU’s <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/balancing-innovation-trust-experts-assess-eu-ai-act/">rules-based approach</a> and the more relaxed US approach, and ensuring SMEs have the resources to integrate AI. A strong emphasis also lies on enhancing digital skills and centralising training to support the AI workforce of the future.</p>



<p>Feryal Clark, Minister for AI and Digital Government, said: &#8220;These findings are further proof the UK is in prime position to take advantage of AI, and highlight our strength in spurring innovation, investment, and collaboration across the public and private sector.</p>



<p>“There is a global race for AI and we’ll be setting out plans for how the UK can use the technology to ramp-up adoption across the economy, kickstart growth, and build an AI sector which can scale and compete on the global stage.”</p>



<p>Antony Walker, Deputy CEO at techUK, added: “To build this progress, government and industry must collaborate to foster innovation, support SMEs, invest in skills, and ensure flexible regulation, cementing the UK’s leadership in the global AI economy.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Agentic AI boosting UK business productivity&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Capita, Secret Escapes, Heathrow, and Bionic are among the organisations that have adopted Salesforce’s Agentforce to boost their productivity.</p>



<p>Adolfo Hernandez, CEO of Capita, said: &#8220;We want to transform Capita’s recruitment process into a fast, seamless and autonomous experience that benefits candidates, our people, and our clients.</p>



<p>“With autonomous agents providing 24/7 support, our goal is to enable candidates to complete the entire recruitment journey within days as opposed to what has historically taken weeks.</p>



<p>Secret Escapes, a curator of luxury travel deals, finds autonomous agents crucial for personalising services to its 60 million European members.</p>



<p>Kate Donaghy, Head of Business Technology at Secret Escapes, added: “Agentforce uses our unified data to automate routine tasks like processing cancellations, updating booking information, or even answering common travel questions about luggage, flight information, and much more—freeing up our customer service agents to handle more complex and last-minute travel needs to better serve our members.”</p>



<p>The UK’s AI readiness is testament to the synergy between government, business, and academia. To maintain its leadership, the UK must sustain its focus on collaboration, skills development, and innovation.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2024, Big Tech is all-in on artificial intelligence, with companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta leading the way.</p>



<p>Their combined spending on AI is projected to exceed a jaw-dropping $240 billion. Why? Because AI isn’t just the future—it’s the present, and the demand for AI-powered tools and infrastructure has never been higher. The companies aren’t just keeping up; they’re setting the pace for the industry.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://dataconomy.com/2024/11/18/big-tech-ai-spending-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scale of their investment</a> is hard to ignore. In the first half of 2023, tech giants poured $74 billion into capital expenditure. By Q3, that number had jumped to $109 billion. In mid-2024, spending reached $104 billion, a remarkable 47% rise over the same period a year earlier. By Q3, the total hit $171 billion.</p>



<p>If this pattern continues, Q4 might add another $70 billion, bringing the total to a truly staggering $240 billion for the year.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why so much spending?</h3>



<p>AI’s potential is immense, and companies are making sure they’re positioned to reap the rewards.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A growing market: AI is projected to create $20 trillion in global economic impact by 2030. In countries like India, AI could contribute $500 billion to GDP by 2025. With stakes this high, big tech isn’t hesitating to invest heavily.</li>



<li>Infrastructure demands: Training and running AI models require massive investment in infrastructure, from data centres to high-performance GPUs. Alphabet increased its capital expenditures by 62% last quarter compared to the previous year, even as it cut its workforce by 9,000 employees to manage costs.</li>



<li>Revenue potential: AI is already proving its value. Microsoft’s AI products are expected to generate $10 billion annually—the fastest-growing segment in the company’s history. Alphabet, meanwhile, uses AI to write over 25% of its new code, streamlining operations.</li>
</ul>



<p>Amazon is also ramping up, with plans to spend $75 billion on capital expenditure in 2024. Meta’s forecast is not far behind, with estimates between $38 and $40 billion. Across the board, organisations recognise that maintaining their edge in AI requires sustained and significant investment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Supporting revenue streams</h3>



<p>What keeps the massive investments keep on coming is the strength of big tech’s core businesses. Last quarter, Alphabet’s digital advertising machine, which is powered by Google’s search engine, generated $49.39 billion in ad revenue, a 12% year-over-year increase. This as a solid foundation that allows Alphabet to pour resources into building out its AI arsenal without destabilising the bottom line.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s diversified revenue streams are another example. While the company spent $20 billion on AI and cloud infrastructure last quarter, its productivity segment, which includes Office, grew by 12% to $28.3 billion, and its personal computing business, boosted by <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/11/18/0022217/google-microsoft-are-spending-massively-on-ai-quarterly-earnings-show" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox and the Activision Blizzard acquisition</a>, grew 17% to $13.2 billion. These successes demonstrate how AI investments can support broader growth strategies.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The financial payoff</h3>



<p>Big tech is already seeing the benefits of its heavy spending. Microsoft’s Azure platform has seen substantial growth, with its AI income approaching $6 billion. Amazon’s AI business is growing at triple-digit rates, and Alphabet reported a 34% jump in profits last quarter, with cloud revenue playing a major role.</p>



<p>Meta, while primarily focused on advertising, is leveraging AI to make its platforms more engaging. AI-driven tools, such as improved feeds and search features keep users on its platforms longer, resulting in new revenue growth.</p>



<p>AI spending shows no signs of slowing down. Tech leaders at Microsoft and Alphabet view AI as a long-term investment critical to their future success. And the results speak for themselves: Alphabet’s cloud revenue is up 35%, while Microsoft’s cloud business grew 20% last quarter.</p>



<p>For the time being, the focus is on scaling up infrastructure and meeting demand. However, the real transformation will come when big tech unlocks AI’s full potential, transforming industries and redefining how we work and live.</p>



<p>By investing in high-quality, centralised data strategies, businesses can ensure trustworthy and accurate AI implementations, and unlock AI’s full potential to drive innovation, improve decision-making, and gain competitive edge. AI’s revolutionary promise is within reach—but only for companies prepared to lay the groundwork for sustainable growth and long-term results.</p>

<p>Discover how chatbots for marketing can boost your ROI with enhanced engagement and instant customer responses.</p>



<p><strong>What are chatbots?</strong></p>



<p>Chatbots are automated software applications designed to simulate human conversation. They interact with users through text or voice, providing immediate responses and performing various tasks. AI<a href="https://bagoodex.io/chat"> <strong>chatbots</strong></a> can understand and process natural language, enabling them to handle complex queries and provide relevant information or services.</p>



<p>Chatbots come in various forms, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Rule-based chatbots: Respond to specific commands predetermined by developers,</li>



<li>AI-driven chatbots: Use machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to understand and adapt to user queries.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The importance of chatbots in marketing</strong></p>



<p>Chatbots have become an essential component in modern marketing strategies. They offer marketers a way to connect with consumers efficiently, enhance customer experience, and streamline interactions.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Enhanced customer engagement: Chatbots engage customers by providing instant responses and personalised interactions,</li>



<li>24/7 availability: They operate around the clock, ensuring customer inquiries are addressed at any time,</li>



<li>Cost-effectiveness: Reduce the need for extensive human customer support, lowering operational costs,</li>



<li>Data collection: Gather valuable customer data and insights for better marketing strategies,</li>



<li>Increased lead generation: Facilitate the collection of leads by interacting with potential customers and capturing their information.</li>
</ul>



<p>Chatbots play a crucial role in improving customer engagement. They provide a dynamic and interactive way for businesses to communicate with their audience, fostering stronger relationships and increasing satisfaction. Chatbots can quickly address common questions, offer recommendations, and guide customers through the purchasing process, creating a more personalised experience.</p>



<p>One of the most valuable features of chatbots is their ability to operate around the clock. Unlike human support teams, chatbots are available 24/7, ensuring customers receive immediate assistance regardless of the time of day. Continuous availability can significantly enhance the customer experience, leading to higher levels of satisfaction and loyalty.</p>



<p>The implementation of chatbots in marketing strategies not only streamlines operations but also delivers a more consistent and fulfilling customer experience. The result is an increase in engagement, satisfaction, and overall effectiveness in marketing campaigns.</p>



<p><strong>Implementing chatbots in marketing strategies</strong></p>



<p>Integrating chatbots into marketing strategies can significantly enhance customer engagement and streamline overall marketing efforts. This section delves into how chatbots can be used for personalised customer interactions and how they facilitate data collection and analysis.</p>



<p>Chatbots offer a unique opportunity to create personalised interactions with customers. By using AI and machine learning, chatbots can tailor responses based on user behaviours, preferences, and past interactions. The personalised approach can make customers feel valued and understood, increasing their satisfaction and loyalty.</p>



<p>Key aspects of personalised customer interactions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Greeting users by name: Addressing customers by their names makes interactions feel more personal and engaging,</li>



<li>Tailored recommendations: Based on previous interactions, chatbots can recommend products, content, or services that align with individual preferences,</li>



<li>Customising responses: Chatbots can adjust their responses based on the user&#8217;s mood, choices, and patterns.</li>
</ul>



<p>Chatbots are important in gathering and analysing customer data. The interactions between users and chatbots generate valuable insights that can be used to optimise marketing strategies. Collecting this data can help businesses understand customer needs, behaviour patterns, and preferences.</p>



<p>Key areas where chatbots aid in data collection and analysis:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>User interaction history: Chatbots store conversation logs, providing insights into common customer queries and issues,</li>



<li>Demographic data: Collecting information like age, location, and interests helps in segmenting the audience for targeted marketing,</li>



<li>Feedback mechanisms: Gathering feedback directly through chatbot interactions allows businesses to gauge customer satisfaction and areas for improvement.</li>
</ul>



<p>In the realm of marketing, using chatbots can significantly boost return on investment (ROI). Two of the primary factors contributing to this increase are cost-effectiveness and enhanced lead generation and conversions.</p>



<p>Chatbots offer substantial cost savings for businesses. By automating customer interactions, businesses can reduce the need for a large customer service team. This not only lowers operational costs but also streamlines processes. The initial investment in chatbot technology is often offset by the long-term savings achieved through decreased labour costs and increased efficiency.</p>



<p>Also, chatbots can play a critical role in lead generation and conversion rates. By engaging users in real-time, chatbots can qualify leads, provide personalised recommendations, and guide users through the sales funnel. Immediate interaction can improve user experience and lead to higher conversion rates.</p>



<p>Utilising chatbots for marketing can lead to higher efficiency, greater customer interaction, and ultimately a better ROI. By understanding and implementing these technologies, businesses can enhance their marketing strategies and achieve substantial financial benefits.</p>
