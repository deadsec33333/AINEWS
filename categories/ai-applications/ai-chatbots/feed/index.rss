<p>Discover how chatbots for marketing can boost your ROI with enhanced engagement and instant customer responses.</p>



<p><strong>What are chatbots?</strong></p>



<p>Chatbots are automated software applications designed to simulate human conversation. They interact with users through text or voice, providing immediate responses and performing various tasks. AI<a href="https://bagoodex.io/chat"> <strong>chatbots</strong></a> can understand and process natural language, enabling them to handle complex queries and provide relevant information or services.</p>



<p>Chatbots come in various forms, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Rule-based chatbots: Respond to specific commands predetermined by developers,</li>



<li>AI-driven chatbots: Use machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to understand and adapt to user queries.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The importance of chatbots in marketing</strong></p>



<p>Chatbots have become an essential component in modern marketing strategies. They offer marketers a way to connect with consumers efficiently, enhance customer experience, and streamline interactions.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Enhanced customer engagement: Chatbots engage customers by providing instant responses and personalised interactions,</li>



<li>24/7 availability: They operate around the clock, ensuring customer inquiries are addressed at any time,</li>



<li>Cost-effectiveness: Reduce the need for extensive human customer support, lowering operational costs,</li>



<li>Data collection: Gather valuable customer data and insights for better marketing strategies,</li>



<li>Increased lead generation: Facilitate the collection of leads by interacting with potential customers and capturing their information.</li>
</ul>



<p>Chatbots play a crucial role in improving customer engagement. They provide a dynamic and interactive way for businesses to communicate with their audience, fostering stronger relationships and increasing satisfaction. Chatbots can quickly address common questions, offer recommendations, and guide customers through the purchasing process, creating a more personalised experience.</p>



<p>One of the most valuable features of chatbots is their ability to operate around the clock. Unlike human support teams, chatbots are available 24/7, ensuring customers receive immediate assistance regardless of the time of day. Continuous availability can significantly enhance the customer experience, leading to higher levels of satisfaction and loyalty.</p>



<p>The implementation of chatbots in marketing strategies not only streamlines operations but also delivers a more consistent and fulfilling customer experience. The result is an increase in engagement, satisfaction, and overall effectiveness in marketing campaigns.</p>



<p><strong>Implementing chatbots in marketing strategies</strong></p>



<p>Integrating chatbots into marketing strategies can significantly enhance customer engagement and streamline overall marketing efforts. This section delves into how chatbots can be used for personalised customer interactions and how they facilitate data collection and analysis.</p>



<p>Chatbots offer a unique opportunity to create personalised interactions with customers. By using AI and machine learning, chatbots can tailor responses based on user behaviours, preferences, and past interactions. The personalised approach can make customers feel valued and understood, increasing their satisfaction and loyalty.</p>



<p>Key aspects of personalised customer interactions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Greeting users by name: Addressing customers by their names makes interactions feel more personal and engaging,</li>



<li>Tailored recommendations: Based on previous interactions, chatbots can recommend products, content, or services that align with individual preferences,</li>



<li>Customising responses: Chatbots can adjust their responses based on the user&#8217;s mood, choices, and patterns.</li>
</ul>



<p>Chatbots are important in gathering and analysing customer data. The interactions between users and chatbots generate valuable insights that can be used to optimise marketing strategies. Collecting this data can help businesses understand customer needs, behaviour patterns, and preferences.</p>



<p>Key areas where chatbots aid in data collection and analysis:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>User interaction history: Chatbots store conversation logs, providing insights into common customer queries and issues,</li>



<li>Demographic data: Collecting information like age, location, and interests helps in segmenting the audience for targeted marketing,</li>



<li>Feedback mechanisms: Gathering feedback directly through chatbot interactions allows businesses to gauge customer satisfaction and areas for improvement.</li>
</ul>



<p>In the realm of marketing, using chatbots can significantly boost return on investment (ROI). Two of the primary factors contributing to this increase are cost-effectiveness and enhanced lead generation and conversions.</p>



<p>Chatbots offer substantial cost savings for businesses. By automating customer interactions, businesses can reduce the need for a large customer service team. This not only lowers operational costs but also streamlines processes. The initial investment in chatbot technology is often offset by the long-term savings achieved through decreased labour costs and increased efficiency.</p>



<p>Also, chatbots can play a critical role in lead generation and conversion rates. By engaging users in real-time, chatbots can qualify leads, provide personalised recommendations, and guide users through the sales funnel. Immediate interaction can improve user experience and lead to higher conversion rates.</p>



<p>Utilising chatbots for marketing can lead to higher efficiency, greater customer interaction, and ultimately a better ROI. By understanding and implementing these technologies, businesses can enhance their marketing strategies and achieve substantial financial benefits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The combination of artificial intelligence and policymaking can occasionally have unforeseen repercussions, as seen recently in Alaska.</p>



<p>In an unusual turn of events, Alaska legislators reportedly used AI-generated citations that were inaccurate to justify a proposed policy banning cellphones in schools. As reported by /The Alaska Beacon/, Alaska’s Department of Education and Early Development (DEED) presented a policy draft containing references to academic studies that simply did not exist.</p>



<p>The situation arose when Alaska’s Education Commissioner, Deena Bishop, used generative AI to draft the cellphone policy. The document produced by the AI included supposed scholarly references that were neither verified nor accurate, yet the document did not disclose the use of AI in its preparation. Some of the AI-generated content reached the Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development before it could be reviewed, potentially influencing board discussions.</p>



<p>Commissioner Bishop later claimed that AI was used only to “create citations” for an initial draft and asserted that she corrected the errors before the meeting by sending updated citations to board members. However, AI “hallucinations”—fabricated information generated when AI attempts to create plausible yet unverified content—were still present in the final document that was voted on by the board.</p>



<p>The final resolution, published on DEED’s website, directs the department to establish a model policy for cellphone restrictions in schools. Unfortunately, the document included six citations, four of which seemed to be from respected scientific journals. However, the references were entirely made up, with URLs that led to unrelated content. The incident shows the risks of using AI-generated data without proper human verification, especially when making policy rulings.</p>



<p>Alaska’s case is not one of a kind. AI hallucinations are increasingly common in a variety of professional sectors. For example, some legal professionals have faced consequences for using AI-generated, fictitious case citations in court. Similarly, academic papers created using AI have included distorted data and fake sources, presenting serious credibility concerns. When left unchecked, generative AI algorithms, which are meant to produce content based on patterns rather than factual accuracy, can easily produce misleading citations.</p>



<p>The reliance on AI-generated data in policymaking, particularly in education, carries significant risks. When policies are developed based on fabricated information, they may misallocate resources and potentially harm students. For instance, a policy restricting cellphone use based on fabricated data may divert attention from more effective, evidence-based interventions that could genuinely benefit students.</p>



<p>Furthermore, using unverified AI data can erode public trust in both the policymaking process and AI technology itself. Such incidents underscore the importance of fact-checking, transparency, and caution when using AI in sensitive decision-making areas, especially in education, where impact on students can be profound.</p>



<p>Alaska officials attempted to downplay the situation, referring to the fabricated citations as “placeholders” intended for later correction. However, the document with the “placeholders” was still presented to the board and used as the basis for a vote, underscoring the need for rigorous oversight when using AI.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a> has announced upgrades to its AI portfolio, including an enhanced Claude 3.5 Sonnet model and the introduction of Claude 3.5 Haiku, alongside a “computer control” feature in public beta.</p>



<p>The upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrates substantial improvements across all metrics, with particularly notable advances in coding capabilities. The model achieved an impressive 49.0% on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, surpassing all publicly available models, including OpenAI&#8217;s offerings and specialist coding systems.</p>



<p>In a pioneering development, Anthropic has introduced computer use functionality that enables Claude to interact with computers similarly to humans: viewing screens, controlling cursors, clicking, and typing. This capability, currently in public beta, marks Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the first frontier AI model to offer such functionality.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Claude | Computer use for automating operations" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ODaHJzOyVCQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Several major technology firms have already begun implementing these new capabilities.</p>



<p>&#8220;The upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet represents a significant leap for AI-powered coding,&#8221; reports GitLab, which noted up to 10% stronger reasoning across use cases without additional latency.</p>



<p>The new Claude 3.5 Haiku model, set for release later this month, matches the performance of the previous Claude 3 Opus whilst maintaining cost-effectiveness and speed. It notably achieved 40.6% on SWE-bench Verified, outperforming many competitive models including the original Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o.</p>

<p>Regarding computer control capabilities, Anthropic has taken a measured approach, acknowledging current limitations whilst highlighting potential. On the OSWorld benchmark, which evaluates computer interface navigation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved 14.9% in screenshot-only tests, significantly outperforming the next-best system&#8217;s 7.8%.</p>



<p>The developments have undergone rigorous <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/uk-and-us-sign-pact-develop-ai-safety-tests/">safety evaluations</a>, with pre-deployment testing conducted in partnership with both the US and UK AI Safety Institutes. Anthropic maintains that the ASL-2 Standard, as detailed in their Responsible Scaling Policy, remains appropriate for these models.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Telefónica&#8217;s corporate venture capital arm, <a href="https://www.wayra.com/">Wayra</a>, has announced its investment in AI answer engine <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity</a>.</p>



<p>Perplexity&#8217;s AI-driven platform aims to revolutionise internet information searches by providing real-time, accurate, and contextual answers to queries using natural language processing. Unlike traditional search engines that return a list of links, Perplexity understands the intent behind questions and delivers clear, concise answers from a curated set of relevant sources.</p>



<p>The investment sees Wayra join an impressive roster of existing backers, including tech giants Nvidia and Databricks, as well as high-profile individuals such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller. Venture capital firms Bessemer Venture Partners, NEA, and IVP have also placed their bets on Perplexity&#8217;s growth and expansion.</p>



<p>In addition to the investment, <a href="https://www.telefonica.com/en/">Telefónica</a> has inked a global commercial agreement with Perplexity. This partnership will offer preferential benefits to Telefónica customers in Brazil, the UK, and Spain, with plans to explore expansion into other markets.</p>



<p>Telefónica has launched a Perplexity experience through television. The company has developed an exclusive living app within the Movistar Plus+ catalogue, allowing customers with compatible sets to interact with Perplexity directly through their TV. Users can ask questions on any topic using the Movistar Plus+ Voice Remote by pressing the Aura button, receiving AI-generated text answers in real-time, displayed on-screen and spoken aloud.</p>



<p>Chema Alonso, Chief Digital Data Officer at Telefónica, said: &#8220;The investment in Perplexity is part of one of the new keys of Wayra&#8217;s investment strategy in leading technology markets such as the US, in high-growth companies with global presence and reach, and leaders in technologies such as AI.</p>



<p>“With this commercial agreement, we are also reinforcing Telefónica&#8217;s commitment to integrating cutting-edge technologies into the company and offering transformative experiences like Perplexity&#8217;s answer engine to our customers&#8221;.</p>



<p>Perplexity&#8217;s AI-powered approach sets it apart from traditional search engines by offering a conversational interface and personalised results. The platform also provides a clear list of cited sources, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of its answers.</p>



<p>Aravind Srinivas, Co-Founder and CEO of Perplexity, commented: &#8220;This investment from Wayra not only validates our AI-powered approach but also opens up exciting opportunities for global expansion.”</p>



<p>By bringing Perplexity&#8217;s capabilities to television screens, Telefónica is delivering new ways for users to access information and interact with AI in their homes.</p>



<p>“We look forward to continuing to partner with Telefónica to push the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible in AI-driven information discovery and to create transformative experiences for users worldwide,” concludes Srinivas.</p>



<p>The investment from Telefónica comes as research suggests the telecoms industry is <a href="https://www.telecomstechnews.com/news/telecoms-industry-leads-generative-ai-adoption/">leading in generative AI adoption</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Amazon is gearing up to roll out a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/amazon-turns-anthropics-claude-alexa-ai-revamp-2024-08-30/" rel="noreferrer noopener">revamped version of its Alexa voice assistant</a>, which is expected to be available this October, right before the US shopping rush.</p>



<p>Internally referred to as &#8220;Remarkable,&#8221; the new technology will be powered by Anthropic&#8217;s <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/anthropics-claude-3-5-sonnet-beats-gpt-4o-most-benchmarks/">Claude</a> AI models. Sources close to the matter have indicated that this shift occurred due to the underperformance of Amazon&#8217;s in-house software.</p>



<p>The enhanced Alexa will operate using advanced generative AI to handle more complex queries. Amazon plans to offer the new Alexa as a subscription service, priced between $5 and $10 per month, while the classic version of Alexa will remain free. This approach marks a significant change for Amazon and suggests that the company aims to turn this voice assistant into a profitable venture after years of limited success in generating revenue through this platform.</p>



<p>Amazon&#8217;s decision to quickly adopt an external model, Claude, indicates a strategic shift. Amazon typically prefers to build everything in-house to minimise its dependence on third-party vendors, thereby avoiding external influences on customer behaviour and business strategies, as well as external influences on who controls data. However, it seems that Amazon&#8217;s traditional strategy does not provide the massive AI capability needed, or perhaps Amazon has realised the need for more powerful AI. It is also worth noting that the involved AI developer, OpenAI, is affiliated with major technology companies <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/apple-reportedly-getting-free-chatgpt-access/">like Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/eu-probes-microsoft-openai-and-google-samsung-ai-deals/">Microsoft</a> in developing AI technologies.</p>



<p>The launch of the &#8220;Remarkable&#8221; Alexa is anticipated during Amazon&#8217;s annual devices and services event in September, though the company has not confirmed the exact date. This event will also mark the first public appearance of Panos Panay, the new head of Amazon&#8217;s devices division, who has taken over from long-time executive David Limp.</p>



<p>The updated version of Alexa would be a more interactive and intuitive assistant, as the new functionality would stem from its conversational mode. The assistant is envisioned to do more than just recognise patterns in people&#8217;s speech; it would be able to hold conversations built on previous interactions. The most likely features include personalised shopping advice, news aggregation, and more advanced home automation. As for whether customers would pay for Alexa, this likely depends on the final set of available features. The issue might be particularly pressing for Amazon, given that customers already pay for Prime membership.</p>



<p>The future for Alexa is quite ambitious, but it also bears significant risks. For the new version to be successful, internal performance benchmarks must be met. While estimates for &#8220;Remarkable&#8221; Alexa suggest that even a small percentage of current users paying for the premium version could become a substantial income stream for Amazon, the likelihood of achieving the expected outcomes remains uncertain.</p>



<p>However, Amazon&#8217;s partnership with Anthropic is currently under regulatory review, largely due to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/amazon-slash-anthropic-partnership-merger-inquiry">an investigation</a> by the UK&#8217;s antitrust regulator. The impending upgrade announcement and the regulator&#8217;s response could significantly influence the company&#8217;s future activities.</p>



<p>Amazon&#8217;s initiative to adopt an AI solution developed by Anthropic marks a significant shift for the company, which previously focused on developing its proprietary technology. At this point, it is possible to view this move as part of the general trend in the industry to turn to partnerships regarding AI development to enhance the competitiveness of products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chinese internet search provider Baidu has <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3275717/baidu-blocks-google-bing-scraping-content-amid-demand-data-used-ai-projects?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=section" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated its Wikipedia-like Baike service</a> to prevent Google and Microsoft Bing from scraping its content.</p>



<p>This change was observed in the latest update to the Baidu Baike robots.txt file, which denies access to Googlebot and Bingbot crawlers.</p>



<p>According to the Wayback Machine, the change took place on August 8. Previously, Google and Bing search engines were allowed to index Baidu Baike&#8217;s central repository, which includes almost 30 million entries, although some target subdomains on the website were restricted.</p>



<p>This action by Baidu comes amid increasing demand for large datasets used in training artificial intelligence models and applications. It follows similar moves by other companies to protect their online content. In July, Reddit blocked various search engines, except Google, from indexing its posts and discussions. Google, <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/openai-secures-key-partnership-with-reddit/">like Reddit</a>, has a financial agreement with Reddit for data access to train its AI services.</p>



<p>According to sources, in the past year, Microsoft considered restricting access to internet-search data for rival search engine operators; this was most relevant for those who used the data for chatbots and generative AI services.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Chinese Wikipedia, with its 1.43 million entries, remains available to search engine crawlers. A survey conducted by the South China Morning Post found that entries from Baidu Baike still appear on both Bing and Google searches. Perhaps the search engines continue to use older cached content.</p>



<p>Such a move is emerging against the background where developers of generative AI around the world are increasingly working with content publishers in a bid to access the highest-quality content for their projects. For instance, relatively recently, OpenAI signed an agreement with Time magazine to access the entire archive, dating back to the very first day of the magazine&#8217;s publication over a century ago. A similar partnership was <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/ft-and-openai-ink-partnership-web-scraping-criticism/">inked</a> with the Financial Times in April.</p>



<p>Baidu&#8217;s decision to restrict access to its Baidu Baike content for major search engines highlights the growing importance of data in the AI era. As companies invest heavily in AI development, the value of large, curated datasets has significantly increased. This has led to a shift in how online platforms manage access to their content, with many choosing to limit or monetise access to their data.</p>



<p>As the AI industry continues to evolve, it&#8217;s likely that more companies will reassess their data-sharing policies, potentially leading to further changes in how information is indexed and accessed across the internet.</p>

<p>Alongside Grok-2, xAI has introduced Grok-2 mini, a smaller but capable version of the main model. Both are currently in beta on X and will be made available through xAI&#8217;s enterprise API later this month.</p>



<p>An early version of Grok-2 was tested on the <a href="https://lmarena.ai/">LMSYS</a> leaderboard under the pseudonym &#8220;sus-column-r&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time of the announcement, xAI claims it is outperforming both Anthropic&#8217;s <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/anthropics-claude-3-5-sonnet-beats-gpt-4o-most-benchmarks/">Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a> and OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-4-Turbo. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/gpt-4o-human-like-ai-interaction-text-audio-vision-integration/">GPT-4o</a> currently holds the top spot as the best AI assistant in terms of overall capabilities, followed by Google&#8217;s <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/googles-gemini-1-5-pro-dethrones-gpt-4o/">Gemini 1.5</a>.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>xAI&#8217;s internal evaluation process employs AI Tutors to assess the models across various real-world tasks. The company states that &#8220;Grok-2 has shown significant improvements in reasoning with retrieved content and in its tool use capabilities, such as correctly identifying missing information, reasoning through sequences of events, and discarding irrelevant posts&#8221;.</p>



<p>Benchmark results shared by xAI indicate that both Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini demonstrate substantial improvements over Grok-1.5. The models show competitive performance in areas such as graduate-level science knowledge, general knowledge, and maths competition problems. Notably, Grok-2 excels in vision-based tasks, delivering state-of-the-art performance in visual maths reasoning and document-based question answering.</p>



<p>The new Grok experience on <a href="https://x.com/">X</a> features a redesigned interface and new features. Premium and Premium+ subscribers will have access to both Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini. xAI describes Grok-2 as &#8220;more intuitive, steerable, and versatile across a wide range of tasks, whether you&#8217;re seeking answers, collaborating on writing, or solving coding tasks&#8221;.</p>



<p>xAI is also collaborating with <a href="https://blackforestlabs.ai/">Black Forest Labs</a> to experiment with their FLUX.1 model to expand Grok&#8217;s capabilities on X.</p>



<p>For developers, xAI is launching an enterprise API platform later this month. The company promises enhanced security features, rich traffic statistics, and advanced billing analytics. A management API will also be available for integrating team, user, and billing management into existing tools and services.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, xAI plans to roll out multimodal understanding as a core part of the Grok experience on both X and the API. The company&#8217;s rapid progress since announcing Grok-1 in November 2023 is attributed to &#8220;a small team with the highest talent density&#8221;.</p>

<p>xAI&#8217;s focus remains on advancing core reasoning capabilities with its new compute cluster, as it aims to maintain its position at the forefront of AI development. However, the company recently agreed <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/x-agrees-halt-use-certain-eu-data-ai-chatbot-training/">to halt the use of certain EU data</a> for training its models.</p>



<p>While the release of Grok-2 marks a significant milestone for xAI, it&#8217;s clear that the AI landscape remains highly competitive. With ChatGPT-4o and Google&#8217;s Gemini 1.5 leading the pack, and other major players like Anthropic continuing to make advancements, the race for AI supremacy is far from over.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recently, the European Union became the centre stage of a data privacy controversy related to the social media platform X.</p>



<p>On August 8, an Irish court declared that X had agreed to suspend the use of all data belonging to European Union citizens, which had been gathered via the platform for the purpose of training the company&#8217;s AI systems. As reported by <em><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/x-agrees-to-not-use-some-eu-user-data-to-train-ai-chatbot/articleshow/112392029.cms?from=mdr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Economic Times</a></em>, this initiative was prompted by complaints from the Data Protection Commission (DPC) of Ireland, the leading EU regulator for many large US tech companies that have their main offices in Ireland under EU law.</p>



<p>Taking action, the DPC&#8217;s intervention comes amid intensified scrutiny of AI development practices across the EU by tech giants. Recently, the regulatory body sought an order to restrain or suspend X&#8217;s data processing activities on users for the development, training, and refinement of an AI system. This situation clearly depicts the growing conflict or tension experienced by nearly all EU states between AI advances and ongoing data protection concerns.</p>



<p>It seems that the order was issued too late by regulators and the court. In the response filed for the lawsuit, X, owned by Elon Musk, reported that Grok—an AI chatbot—allowed its users to skip their public posts.</p>



<p>As Judge Leonie Reynolds noted, X began processing European users&#8217; data for AI training on May 7, but the opt-out option was not introduced until July 16. Furthermore, it was not immediately made available to all users. Therefore, there was a period when the data was used without the users&#8217; consent.</p>



<p>X&#8217;s legal representation has assured the court that data obtained from EU users between May 7 and August 1 will not be used while the DPC&#8217;s order is under consideration. It is expected that X will file opposition papers arguing against the suspension order by September 4. This will set in motion what could be a court battle with effects reverberating throughout the EU.</p>



<p>Either way, X has not remained silent on the matter. In its <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GlobalAffairs/status/1820957979111297059" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>, the company&#8217;s Global Government Affairs account on X noted that the DPC&#8217;s order was &#8220;unwarranted, overbroad, and singles out X without any justification.&#8221; Furthermore, the company expressed concerns that the order would undermine efforts to keep the platform safe and restrict its use of technologies in the EU. This highlights the complex balance between regulatory compliance and operational viability that tech companies must navigate in the current digital landscape.</p>



<p>The platform emphasised its proactive approach in working with regulators, including the DPC, regarding Grok since late 2023. X claims to have been fully transparent about the use of public data for AI models, including providing necessary legal assessments and engaging in lengthy discussions with regulators.</p>



<p>This regulatory action against X is not an isolated incident. Other tech giants have faced similar scrutiny in recent months. Meta Platforms recently decided to postpone the launch of its Meta AI models in Europe following advice from the Irish DPC. Similarly, Google agreed to delay and modify its Gemini AI chatbot earlier this year after consultations with the Irish regulator.</p>



<p>These developments collectively signal a shift in the regulatory landscape of AI and data usage in the EU. Regulators are taking a more active role in overseeing how tech companies utilise user data for AI training and development, reflecting growing concerns about data privacy and the ethical implications of AI advancement.</p>



<p>As the legal proceedings unfold, the outcome of this case could set important precedents for how AI development is regulated in the EU, potentially influencing global standards for data protection in the AI era. The tech industry and privacy advocates alike will be watching closely as this situation develops, recognising its potential to shape the future of AI innovation and data privacy regulations.</p>

<p>Google’s experimental <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/pro/">Gemini 1.5 Pro</a> model has surpassed OpenAI&#8217;s <a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/">GPT-4o</a> in generative AI benchmarks.</p>



<p>For the past year, OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-4o and Anthropic&#8217;s <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family">Claude-3</a> have dominated the landscape. However, the latest version of Gemini 1.5 Pro appears to have taken the lead.</p>



<p>One of the most widely recognised benchmarks in the AI community is the LMSYS Chatbot Arena, which <a href="https://chat.lmsys.org/">evaluates</a> models on various tasks and assigns an overall competency score. On this leaderboard, GPT-4o achieved a score of 1,286, while Claude-3 secured a commendable 1,271. A previous iteration of Gemini 1.5 Pro had scored 1,261.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="548" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chatbot-comparison-google-gemini-1.5-pro-1024x548.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15618" srcset="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chatbot-comparison-google-gemini-1.5-pro-1024x548.png 1024w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chatbot-comparison-google-gemini-1.5-pro-300x161.png 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chatbot-comparison-google-gemini-1.5-pro-768x411.png 768w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chatbot-comparison-google-gemini-1.5-pro-1536x822.png 1536w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chatbot-comparison-google-gemini-1.5-pro-2048x1096.png 2048w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chatbot-comparison-google-gemini-1.5-pro-374x200.png 374w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chatbot-comparison-google-gemini-1.5-pro-380x203.png 380w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chatbot-comparison-google-gemini-1.5-pro-350x187.png 350w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chatbot-comparison-google-gemini-1.5-pro-100x54.png 100w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chatbot-comparison-google-gemini-1.5-pro-60x32.png 60w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The experimental version of Gemini 1.5 Pro (designated as Gemini 1.5 Pro 0801) surpassed its closest rivals with an impressive score of 1,300. This significant improvement suggests that Google&#8217;s latest model may possess greater overall capabilities than its competitors.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that while benchmarks provide valuable insights into an AI model&#8217;s performance, they may not always accurately represent the full spectrum of its abilities or limitations in real-world applications.</p>

<p>Despite Gemini 1.5 Pro’s current availability, the fact that it&#8217;s labelled as an early release or in a testing phase suggests that Google may still make adjustments or even withdraw the model for safety or alignment reasons.</p>



<p>This development marks a significant milestone in the ongoing race for AI supremacy among tech giants. Google&#8217;s ability to surpass OpenAI and Anthropic in benchmark scores demonstrates the rapid pace of innovation in the field and the intense competition driving these advancements.</p>



<p>As the AI landscape continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how OpenAI and Anthropic respond to this challenge from Google. Will they be able to reclaim their positions at the top of the leaderboard, or has Google established a new standard for generative AI performance?</p>

<p>In a fireside chat at <a href="https://s2024.siggraph.org/">SIGGRAPH 2024</a>, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang and Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared their insights on the potential of open source AI and virtual assistants.</p>



<p>The conversation began with Zuckerberg announcing the launch of <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/create-your-own-custom-ai-with-ai-studio/">AI Studio</a>, a new platform designed to democratise AI creation. This tool allows users to create, share, and discover AI characters, potentially opening up AI development to millions of creators and small businesses.</p>



<p>Huang emphasised the ubiquity of AI in the future, stating, &#8220;Every single restaurant, every single website will probably, in the future, have these AIs …&#8221;</p>



<p>Zuckerberg concurred, adding, &#8220;…just like every business has an email address and a website and a social media account, I think, in the future, every business is going to have an AI.&#8221;</p>



<p>This vision aligns with NVIDIA&#8217;s recent developments showcased at SIGGRAPH. The company previewed &#8220;James,&#8221; an interactive digital human based on the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA ACE</a> (Avatar Cloud Engine) reference design. <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/digital-humans-siggraph-2024/">James</a> – a virtual assistant capable of providing contextually accurate responses – demonstrates the potential for businesses to create custom, hyperrealistic avatars for customer interactions.</p>



<p>The discussion highlighted Meta&#8217;s significant contributions to AI development. Huang praised Meta&#8217;s work, saying, &#8220;You guys have done amazing AI work,&#8221; and cited advancements in computer vision, language models, and real-time translation. He also acknowledged the widespread use of <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>, an open-source machine learning framework developed by Meta.</p>

<p>Both CEOs stressed the importance of open source in advancing AI. Meta has positioned itself as a leader in this field, implementing AI across its platforms and releasing open-source models like <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/meta-advances-open-source-ai-frontier-level-llama-3-1/">Llama 3.1</a>. This latest model, with 405 billion parameters, required training on over 16,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, representing a substantial investment in resources.</p>



<p>Zuckerberg shared his vision for more integrated AI models, saying, &#8220;I kind of dream of one day like you can almost imagine all of Facebook or Instagram being like a single AI model that has unified all these different content types and systems together.&#8221; He believes that collaboration is crucial for further advancements in AI.</p>



<p>The conversation touched on the potential of AI to enhance human productivity. Huang described a future where AI could generate images in real-time as users type, allowing for fluid collaboration between humans and AI assistants. This concept is reflected in NVIDIA&#8217;s latest advancements to the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/maxine">NVIDIA Maxine AI</a> platform, including Maxine 3D and Audio2Face-2D, which aim to create immersive telepresence experiences.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Zuckerberg expressed enthusiasm about combining AI with augmented reality eyewear, mentioning Meta&#8217;s collaboration with eyewear maker Luxottica. He envisions this technology transforming education, entertainment, and work.</p>



<p>Huang discussed the evolution of AI interactions, moving beyond turn-based conversations to more complex, multi-option simulations. &#8220;Today&#8217;s AI is kind of turn-based. You say something, it says something back to you,&#8221; Huang explained. &#8220;In the future, AI could contemplate multiple options, or come up with a tree of options and simulate outcomes, making it much more powerful.&#8221;</p>



<p>The importance of this evolution is evident in the adoption of NVIDIA&#8217;s technologies by companies across industries. HTC, Looking Glass, Reply, and UneeQ are among the latest firms using NVIDIA ACE and Maxine for applications ranging from customer service agents to telepresence experiences in entertainment, retail, and hospitality.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>As AI continues to evolve and integrate into various aspects of our lives, the insights shared by these industry leaders provide a glimpse into a future where AI assistants are as commonplace as websites and social media accounts.</p>



<p>The developments showcased at SIGGRAPH 2024 by both NVIDIA and other companies demonstrate that this future is rapidly approaching, with digital humans becoming increasingly sophisticated and capable of natural, engaging interactions.</p>
