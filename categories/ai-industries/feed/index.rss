										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>OpenAI is awarding a $1 million grant to a Duke University research team to look at how AI could predict human moral judgments.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.eweek.com/news/openai-funding-ai-morality-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initiative</a> highlights the growing focus on the intersection of technology and ethics, and raises critical questions: Can AI handle the complexities of morality, or should ethical decisions remain the domain of humans?</p>



<p>Duke University’s Moral Attitudes and Decisions Lab (MADLAB), led by ethics professor Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and co-investigator Jana Schaich Borg, is in charge of the “Making Moral AI” project. The team envisions a “moral GPS,” a tool that could guide ethical decision-making.</p>



<p>Its research spans diverse fields, including computer science, philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, to understand how moral attitudes and decisions are formed and how AI can contribute to the process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The role of AI in morality</h3>



<p>MADLAB’s work examines how AI might predict or influence moral judgments. Imagine an algorithm assessing ethical dilemmas, such as deciding between two unfavourable outcomes in autonomous vehicles or providing guidance on ethical business practices. Such scenarios underscore AI’s potential but also raise fundamental questions: Who determines the moral framework guiding these types of tools, and should AI be trusted to make decisions with ethical implications?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">OpenAI’s vision</h3>



<p>The grant supports the development of algorithms that forecast human moral judgments in areas such as medical, law, and business, which frequently involve complex ethical trade-offs. While promising, AI still struggles to grasp the emotional and cultural nuances of morality. Current systems excel at recognising patterns but lack the deeper understanding required for ethical reasoning.</p>



<p>Another concern is how this technology might be applied. While AI could assist in life-saving decisions, its use in defence strategies or surveillance introduces moral dilemmas. Can unethical AI actions be justified if they serve national interests or align with societal goals? These questions emphasise the difficulties of embedding morality into AI systems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges and opportunities</h3>



<p>Integrating ethics into AI is a formidable challenge that requires collaboration across disciplines. Morality is not universal; it is shaped by cultural, personal, and societal values, making it difficult to encode into algorithms. Additionally, without safeguards such as transparency and accountability, there is a risk of perpetuating biases or enabling harmful applications.</p>



<p>OpenAI’s investment in Duke’s research marks at step toward understanding the role of AI in ethical decision-making. However, the journey is far from over. Developers and policymakers must work together to ensure that AI tools align with social values, and emphasise fairness and inclusivity while addressing biases and unintended consequences.</p>



<p>As AI becomes more integral to decision-making, its ethical implications demand attention. Projects like “Making Moral AI” offer a starting point for navigating a complex landscape, balancing innovation with responsibility in order to shape a future where technology serves the greater good.</p>

<p>As we approach a new year filled with potential, the landscape of technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), is on the brink of significant transformation. Manish Jethwa, CTO at Ordnance Survey (OS), the national mapping agency for Great Britain, offers an insightful glimpse into what we can expect from these advancements and their implications for the geospatial sector.</p>



<p><strong>Breaking Down Barriers with AI</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="512" height="489" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16778" style="width:314px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394.jpg 512w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-300x287.jpg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-209x200.jpg 209w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-298x285.jpg 298w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-262x250.jpg 262w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-100x96.jpg 100w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Manish-ordnance-e1734707204394-60x57.jpg 60w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure></div>


<p>Looking ahead, Jethwa anticipates continued significant advancements in AI and machine learning, particularly with the push towards Gen AI. According to him, the integration of large language models (LLMs) with more sophisticated agents will not only perform complex tasks on behalf of users but also further reduce barriers to interaction. This shift, especially in the geospatial field, means that translating natural language into precise data queries will become more seamless, ultimately making geospatial datasets more accessible, mainstream, and user-friendly.</p>



<p><strong>Training for Complex Tasks</strong></p>



<p>Beyond LLMs, Jethwa is optimistic about progress in the broader category of machine learning, driven by greater access to graphics processing units for training.</p>



<p>He says: “At Ordnance Survey (OS), we’ll leverage this capability to train models for specific, complex tasks such as automatic feature extraction from imagery.</p>



<p>“With an increasing volume of data generated automatically, hopefully next year will also bring innovative tools and techniques to validate data, ensuring it can be confidently utilised for its intended use.”</p>



<p>He underscores the importance of not only pursuing new capabilities but also ensuring that these tools are integrated responsibly into workflows, focusing on quality and risk management.</p>



<p><strong>The Ethical Frontier</strong></p>



<p>The rapid evolution of AI brings with it an urgent need for ethical considerations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jethwa explains: “I would like to see a greater emphasis on ethical AI and responsible technology development,&#8221; including creating AI systems that are “transparent, fair, and unbiased” while also considering their environmental and societal impact.</p>



<p>This focus on ethics is encapsulated in OS’s Responsible AI Charter, which guides their approach to integrating new techniques safely.</p>



<p>Moreover, Jethwa highlights the role of workforce development in successful transformations. He believes organisations must commit to “retraining and upskilling employees to prepare them for the impact of AI and digital transformation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is vital to ensure that in the pursuit of enhanced efficiency, companies do not “lose the personality, creativity, and emotion that we bring as humans into the workplace.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Embracing Change While Managing Risks</strong></p>



<p>Despite the promise of technological advancements, obstacles remain in the journey toward digital transformation. Jethwa notes that challenges such as “cultural resistance and rapid successive changes leading to change fatigue will likely persist.” </p>



<p>He advocates for a careful balance between adopting new technologies and addressing the human elements of transformation processes.</p>



<p>As AI continues to influence various aspects of business, from decision-making to risk management, the issue of cybersecurity also looms large. Jethwa points out that “cybersecurity threats being powered by AI are becoming more sophisticated,” urging companies to develop comprehensive strategies that cover everything from data storage to analysis documentation.</p>



<p><strong>The Imperative to Progress</strong></p>



<p>In an evolving landscape, organisations that stagnate risk falling behind their competitors. Jethwa explains: “Companies that fail to keep up open themselves up to risks, such as changing customer expectations as well as attracting and retaining talent.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also emphasises the need for a “clear vision of future goals, effective communication of progress, and celebrating milestones to sustain momentum” in digital transformation initiatives.</p>



<p>As we move into a new year filled with promise, the future of AI and geospatial technology holds transformative power &#8211; but it must be used responsibly. The path that lies ahead in 2025 requires vigilance, an unwavering commitment to ethical practices and a human touch in order to drive successful innovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency">MHRA</a>) has announced the selection of five healthcare technologies for its ‘AI Airlock’ scheme.</p>



<p>AI Airlock aims to refine the process of regulating AI-driven medical devices and help fast-track their safe introduction to the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) and patients in need.</p>



<p>The technologies chosen for this scheme include solutions targeting cancer and chronic respiratory diseases, as well as advancements in radiology diagnostics. These AI systems promise to revolutionise the accuracy and efficiency of healthcare, potentially driving better diagnostic tools and patient care.</p>



<p>The AI Airlock, as described by the MHRA, is a “sandbox” environment—an experimental framework designed to help manufacturers determine how best to collect real-world evidence to support the regulatory approval of their devices.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional medical devices, AI models continue to evolve through learning, making the establishment of safety and efficacy evidence more complex. The Airlock enables this exploration within a monitored virtual setting, giving developers insight into the practical challenges of regulation while supporting the NHS’s broader adoption of transformative AI technologies.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Safely enabling AI healthcare innovation&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Laura Squire, the lead figure in MedTech regulatory reform and Chief Officer at the MHRA, said: “New AI medical devices have the potential to increase the accuracy of healthcare decisions, save time, and improve efficiency—leading to better outcomes for the NHS and patients across all healthcare settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But we need to be confident that AI-powered medical devices introduced into the NHS are safe, stay safe, and perform as intended through their lifetime of use.”</p>



<p>Squire emphasised that the AI Airlock pilot allows collaboration “in partnership with technology specialists, developers and the NHS,” facilitating the exploration of best practices and accelerating safe patient access to innovative solutions.</p>



<p>Government representatives have praised the initiative for its forward-thinking framework.</p>



<p>Karin Smyth, Minister of State for Health, commented: “As part of our 10-Year Health Plan, we’re shifting NHS care from analogue to digital, and this project will help bring the most promising technology to patients.</p>



<p>“AI has the power to revolutionise care by supporting doctors to diagnose diseases, automating time-consuming admin tasks, and reducing hospital admissions by predicting future ill health.”</p>



<p>Science Minister Lord Vallance lauded the AI Airlock pilot as “a great example of government working with businesses to enable them to turn ideas into products that improve lives.” He added, “This shows how good regulation can facilitate emerging technologies for the benefit of the UK and our economy.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Selected technologies&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The deployment of AI-powered medical devices requires meeting stringent criteria to ensure innovation, patient benefits, and regulatory challenge readiness. The five technologies selected for this inaugural pilot offer vital insights into healthcare’s future:&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Lenus Stratify</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are among those who stand to benefit significantly from AI innovation. Lenus Stratify, developed by Lenus Health, analyses patient data to predict severe lung disease outcomes, reducing unscheduled hospital admissions. The system empowers care providers to adopt earlier interventions, affording patients an improved quality of life while alleviating NHS resource strain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Philips Radiology Reporting Enhancer</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Philips has integrated AI into existing radiology workflows to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of critical radiology reports. This system uses AI to prepare the “Impression” section of reports, summarising essential diagnostic information for healthcare providers. By automating this process, Philips aims to minimise workload struggles, human errors, and miscommunication, creating a more seamless diagnostic experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Federated AI Monitoring Service (FAMOS)</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>One recurring AI challenge is the concept of “drift,” when changing real-world conditions impair system performance over time. Newton’s Tree has developed FAMOS to monitor AI models in real time, flagging degradation and enabling rapid corrections. Hospitals, regulators, and software developers can use this tool to ensure algorithms remain high-performing, adapting to evolving circumstances while prioritising patient safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>OncoFlow Personalised Cancer Management</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Targeting the pressing healthcare challenge of reducing waiting times for cancer treatment, OncoFlow speeds up clinical workflows through its intelligent care pathway platform. Initially applied to breast cancer protocols, the system later aims to expand across other oncology domains. With quicker access to tailored therapies, patients gain increased survival rates amidst mounting NHS pressures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="5" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>SmartGuideline</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Developed to simplify complex clinical decision-making processes, SmartGuideline uses large-language AI trained on official NICE medical guidelines. This technology allows clinicians to ask routine questions and receive verified, precise answers, eliminating the ambiguity associated with current AI language models. By integrating this tool, patients benefit from more accurate treatments grounded in up-to-date medical knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Broader implications&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The influence of the AI Airlock extends beyond its current applications. The MHRA expects pilot findings, due in 2025, to inform future medical device regulations and create a clearer path for manufacturers developing AI-enabled technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The evidence derived will contribute to shaping post-Brexit UKCA marking processes, helping manufacturers achieve compliance with higher levels of transparency. By improving regulatory frameworks, the UK could position itself as a global hub for med-tech innovation while ensuring faster access to life-saving tools.</p>



<p>The urgency of these developments was underscored earlier this year in Lord Darzi’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-investigation-of-the-nhs-in-england">review</a> of health and care. The report outlined the “critical state” of the NHS, offering AI interventions as a promising pathway to sustainability. The work on AI Airlock by the MHRA addresses one of the report’s major recommendations for enabling regulatory solutions and “unlocking the AI revolution” for healthcare advancements.</p>



<p>While being selected into the AI Airlock pilot does not indicate regulatory approval, the technologies chosen represent a potential leap forward in applying AI to some of healthcare’s most pressing challenges. The coming years will test the potential of these solutions under regulatory scrutiny.</p>



<p>If successful, the initiative from the MHRA could redefine how pioneering technologies like AI are adopted in <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/categories/ai-industries/healthcare/">healthcare</a>, balancing the need for speed, safety, and efficiency. With the NHS under immense pressure from growing demand, AI’s ability to augment clinicians, predict illnesses, and streamline workflows may well be the game-changer the system urgently needs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Salesforce has unveiled the findings of its <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/uk/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/12/Salesforce-UK-AI-Readiness-Index.pdf">UK AI Readiness Index</a>, signalling the nation is in a position to spearhead the next wave of AI innovation, also known as agentic AI.</p>



<p>The report places the UK ahead of its G7 counterparts in terms of AI adoption but also underscores areas ripe for improvement, such as support for SMEs, fostering cross-sector partnerships, and investing in talent development.</p>



<p>Zahra Bahrololoumi CBE, UKI CEO at Salesforce, commented: “Agentic AI is revolutionising enterprise software by enabling humans and agents to collaborate seamlessly and drive customer success.</p>



<p>“The UK AI Readiness Index positively highlights that the UK has both the vision and infrastructure to be a powerhouse globally in AI, and lead the current third wave of agentic AI.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">UK AI adoption sets the stage for agentic revolution</h3>



<p>The Index details how both the public and private sectors in the UK have embraced AI&#8217;s transformative potential. With a readiness score of 65.5, surpassing the G7 average of 61.2, the UK is establishing itself as a hub for large-scale AI projects, driven by a robust innovation culture and pragmatic regulatory approaches.</p>



<p>The government has played its part in maintaining a stable and secure environment for tech investment. Initiatives such as the <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/uk-reveals-ai-safety-summit-opening-day-agenda/">AI Safety Summit</a> at Bletchley Park and risk-oriented AI legislation showcase Britain&#8217;s leadership on critical AI issues like transparency and privacy.</p>



<p>Business readiness is equally impressive, with UK industries scoring 52, well above the G7 average of 47.8. SMEs in the UK are increasingly prioritising AI adoption, further bolstering the nation&#8217;s stance in the international AI arena.</p>



<p>Adam Evans, EVP &amp; GM of Salesforce AI Platform, is optimistic about the evolution of agentic AI. Evans foresees that, by 2025, these agents will become business-aware—expertly navigating industry-specific challenges to execute meaningful tasks and decisions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Investments fuelling AI growth</h3>



<p>Salesforce is committing $4 billion to the UK’s AI ecosystem over the next five years. Since establishing its UK AI Centre in London, Salesforce says it has engaged over 3,000 stakeholders in AI training and workshops.</p>



<p>Key investment focuses include creating a regulatory bridge between the EU’s <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/balancing-innovation-trust-experts-assess-eu-ai-act/">rules-based approach</a> and the more relaxed US approach, and ensuring SMEs have the resources to integrate AI. A strong emphasis also lies on enhancing digital skills and centralising training to support the AI workforce of the future.</p>



<p>Feryal Clark, Minister for AI and Digital Government, said: &#8220;These findings are further proof the UK is in prime position to take advantage of AI, and highlight our strength in spurring innovation, investment, and collaboration across the public and private sector.</p>



<p>“There is a global race for AI and we’ll be setting out plans for how the UK can use the technology to ramp-up adoption across the economy, kickstart growth, and build an AI sector which can scale and compete on the global stage.”</p>



<p>Antony Walker, Deputy CEO at techUK, added: “To build this progress, government and industry must collaborate to foster innovation, support SMEs, invest in skills, and ensure flexible regulation, cementing the UK’s leadership in the global AI economy.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Agentic AI boosting UK business productivity&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Capita, Secret Escapes, Heathrow, and Bionic are among the organisations that have adopted Salesforce’s Agentforce to boost their productivity.</p>



<p>Adolfo Hernandez, CEO of Capita, said: &#8220;We want to transform Capita’s recruitment process into a fast, seamless and autonomous experience that benefits candidates, our people, and our clients.</p>



<p>“With autonomous agents providing 24/7 support, our goal is to enable candidates to complete the entire recruitment journey within days as opposed to what has historically taken weeks.</p>



<p>Secret Escapes, a curator of luxury travel deals, finds autonomous agents crucial for personalising services to its 60 million European members.</p>



<p>Kate Donaghy, Head of Business Technology at Secret Escapes, added: “Agentforce uses our unified data to automate routine tasks like processing cancellations, updating booking information, or even answering common travel questions about luggage, flight information, and much more—freeing up our customer service agents to handle more complex and last-minute travel needs to better serve our members.”</p>



<p>The UK’s AI readiness is testament to the synergy between government, business, and academia. To maintain its leadership, the UK must sustain its focus on collaboration, skills development, and innovation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.superintelligence.io/">ASI Alliance</a> has introduced AIRIS (Autonomous Intelligent Reinforcement Inferred Symbolism) that “learns” within the popular game, <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a>.</p>



<p>AIRIS represents the first proto-AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) to harness a comprehensive tech stack across the alliance.</p>



<p>SingularityNET, founded by renowned AI researcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Goertzel">Dr Ben Goertzel</a>, uses agent technology from Fetch.ai, incorporates Ocean Data for long-term memory capabilities, and is soon expected to integrate CUDOS Compute infrastructure for scalable processing power.</p>



<p>“AIRIS is a significant step in the direction of practical, scalable neural-symbolic learning, and – alongside its already powerful and valuable functionality – it illustrates several general points about neural-symbolic systems, such as their ability to learn precise generalisable conclusions from small amounts of data,” explains Goertzel.</p>



<p>According to the company, this alliance-driven procedure propels AIRIS towards AGI—crafting one of the first intelligent systems with autonomous and adaptive learning that holds practical applications for real-world scenarios.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AIRIS&#8217; learning mechanisms</h3>



<p>AIRIS is crafted to enhance its understanding by interacting directly with its environment, venturing beyond the traditional AI limitations that depend on predefined rules or vast datasets. Instead, AIRIS evolves through observation, experimentation, and continual refinement of its unique “rule set.”</p>



<p>This system facilitates a profound level of problem-solving and contextual comprehension, with its implementation in Minecraft setting a new benchmark for AI interaction with both digital and tangible landscapes.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Shifting from a controlled 2D grid to the sophisticated 3D world of Minecraft, AIRIS faced numerous challenges—including terrain navigation and adaptive problem-solving in a dynamic environment. This transition underscores AIRIS&#8217; autonomy in navigation, exploration, and learning.</p>



<p>The AIRIS Minecraft Agent distinguishes itself from other AI entities through several key features:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Dynamic navigation:</strong> AIRIS initially evaluates its milieu to formulate movement strategies, adapting to new environments in real-time. Its capabilities include manoeuvring around obstacles, jumping over barriers, and anticipating reactions to varied terrains.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Obstacle adaptation:</strong> It learns to navigate around impediments like cliffs and forested areas, refining its rule set with every new challenge to avoid redundant errors and minimise needless trial-and-error efforts.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Efficient pathfinding:</strong> Via continuous optimisation, AIRIS advances from initially complex navigation paths to streamlined, direct routes as it &#8220;comprehends&#8221; Minecraft dynamics.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Real-time environmental adaptation:</strong> Contrasting with conventional reinforcement learning systems that demand extensive retraining for new environments, AIRIS adapts immediately to unfamiliar regions, crafting new rules based on partial observations dynamically.</li>
</ul>



<p>AIRIS&#8217; adeptness in dealing with fluctuating terrains, including water bodies and cave systems, introduces sophisticated rule refinement founded on hands-on experience. Additionally, AIRIS boasts optimised computational efficiency—enabling real-time management of complex rules without performance compromises.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Future applications</h3>



<p>Minecraft serves as an excellent launchpad for AIRIS&#8217; prospective applications, establishing a solid foundation for expansive implementations:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Enhanced object interaction:</strong> Forthcoming stages will empower AIRIS to engage more profoundly with its surroundings, improving capabilities in object manipulation, construction, and even crafting. This development will necessitate AIRIS to develop a more refined decision-making framework for contextual tasks.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Social AI collaboration:</strong> Plans are underway to incorporate AIRIS in multi-agent scenarios, where agents learn, interact, and fulfil shared objectives, simulating real-world social dynamics and problem-solving collaboratively.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Abstract and strategic reasoning:</strong> Expanded developments will enhance AIRIS’s reasoning, enabling it to tackle complex goals such as resource management and prioritisation, moving beyond basic navigation towards strategic gameplay.</li>
</ul>



<p>The transition of AIRIS to 3D environments signifies a pivotal advancement in the ASI Alliance’s mission to cultivate AGI. Through AIRIS’s achievements in navigating and learning within Minecraft, the ASI Alliance aspires to expedite its deployment in the real world, pioneering applications for autonomous robots, intelligent home assistants, and other systems requiring adaptive learning and problem-solving capacities.</p>



<p>Berick Cook, AI Developer at SingularityNET and creator of AIRIS, said: “AIRIS is a whole new way of approaching the problem of machine learning. We are only just beginning to explore its capabilities. We are excited to see how we can apply it to problems that have posed a significant challenge for traditional reinforcement learning.</p>



<p>“The most important aspect of AIRIS to me is its transparency and explainability. Moving away from ‘Black Box’ AI represents a significant leap forward in the pursuit of safe, ethical, and beneficial AI.”</p>



<p>The innovative approach to AI evident in AIRIS – emphasising self-directed learning and continuous rule refinement – lays the foundation for AI systems capable of independent functioning in unpredictable real-world environments. Minecraft’s intricate ecosystem enables the system to hone its skills within a controlled yet expansive virtual setting, effectively bridging the divide between simulation and reality.</p>



<p>The AIRIS Minecraft Agent represents the inaugural tangible step towards an AI that learns from, adapts to and makes autonomous decisions about its environment. This accomplishment illustrates the potential of such technology to re-envision AI&#8217;s role across various industries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The combination of artificial intelligence and policymaking can occasionally have unforeseen repercussions, as seen recently in Alaska.</p>



<p>In an unusual turn of events, Alaska legislators reportedly used AI-generated citations that were inaccurate to justify a proposed policy banning cellphones in schools. As reported by /The Alaska Beacon/, Alaska’s Department of Education and Early Development (DEED) presented a policy draft containing references to academic studies that simply did not exist.</p>



<p>The situation arose when Alaska’s Education Commissioner, Deena Bishop, used generative AI to draft the cellphone policy. The document produced by the AI included supposed scholarly references that were neither verified nor accurate, yet the document did not disclose the use of AI in its preparation. Some of the AI-generated content reached the Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development before it could be reviewed, potentially influencing board discussions.</p>



<p>Commissioner Bishop later claimed that AI was used only to “create citations” for an initial draft and asserted that she corrected the errors before the meeting by sending updated citations to board members. However, AI “hallucinations”—fabricated information generated when AI attempts to create plausible yet unverified content—were still present in the final document that was voted on by the board.</p>



<p>The final resolution, published on DEED’s website, directs the department to establish a model policy for cellphone restrictions in schools. Unfortunately, the document included six citations, four of which seemed to be from respected scientific journals. However, the references were entirely made up, with URLs that led to unrelated content. The incident shows the risks of using AI-generated data without proper human verification, especially when making policy rulings.</p>



<p>Alaska’s case is not one of a kind. AI hallucinations are increasingly common in a variety of professional sectors. For example, some legal professionals have faced consequences for using AI-generated, fictitious case citations in court. Similarly, academic papers created using AI have included distorted data and fake sources, presenting serious credibility concerns. When left unchecked, generative AI algorithms, which are meant to produce content based on patterns rather than factual accuracy, can easily produce misleading citations.</p>



<p>The reliance on AI-generated data in policymaking, particularly in education, carries significant risks. When policies are developed based on fabricated information, they may misallocate resources and potentially harm students. For instance, a policy restricting cellphone use based on fabricated data may divert attention from more effective, evidence-based interventions that could genuinely benefit students.</p>



<p>Furthermore, using unverified AI data can erode public trust in both the policymaking process and AI technology itself. Such incidents underscore the importance of fact-checking, transparency, and caution when using AI in sensitive decision-making areas, especially in education, where impact on students can be profound.</p>



<p>Alaska officials attempted to downplay the situation, referring to the fabricated citations as “placeholders” intended for later correction. However, the document with the “placeholders” was still presented to the board and used as the basis for a vote, underscoring the need for rigorous oversight when using AI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A global study has unveiled a stark contrast in attitudes towards embracing in-vehicle AI between Eastern and Western markets, with European drivers particularly reluctant.</p>



<p>The research – conducted by <a href="https://www.mhp.com/">MHP</a> – surveyed 4,700 car drivers across China, the US, Germany, the UK, Italy, Sweden, and Poland, revealing significant geographical disparities in AI acceptance and understanding.</p>



<p>According to the study, while AI is becoming integral to modern vehicles, European consumers remain hesitant about its implementation and value proposition.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Regional disparities</h3>



<p>The study found that 48 percent of Chinese respondents view in-car AI predominantly as an opportunity, while merely 23 percent of European respondents share this optimistic outlook. In Europe, 39 percent believe AI&#8217;s opportunities and risks are broadly balanced, while 24 percent take a negative stance, suggesting the risks outweigh potential benefits.</p>



<p>Understanding of AI technology also varies significantly by region. While over 80 percent of Chinese respondents claim to understand AI&#8217;s use in cars, this figure drops to just 54 percent among European drivers, highlighting a notable knowledge gap.</p>



<p>Marcus Willand, Partner at MHP and one of the study&#8217;s authors, notes: &#8220;The figures show that the prospect of greater safety and comfort due to AI can motivate purchasing decisions. However, the European respondents in particular are often hesitant and price-sensitive.&#8221;</p>



<p>The willingness to pay for AI features shows an equally stark divide. Just 23 percent of European drivers expressed willingness to pay for AI functions, compared to 39 percent of Chinese drivers. The study suggests that most users now expect AI features to be standard rather than optional extras.</p>

<p>Dr Nils Schaupensteiner, Associated Partner at MHP and study co-author, said: &#8220;Automotive companies need to create innovations with clear added value and develop both direct and indirect monetisation of their AI offerings, for example through data-based business models and improved services.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In-vehicle AI opportunities</h3>



<p>Despite these challenges, traditional automotive manufacturers maintain a trust advantage over tech giants. The study reveals that 64 percent of customers trust established car manufacturers with AI implementation, compared to 50 percent for technology firms like Apple, Google, and Microsoft.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="746" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-1024x746.jpg" alt="Graph highlighting the public trust in various stakeholders regarding in-vehicle AI." class="wp-image-16439" srcset="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-1024x746.jpg 1024w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-300x219.jpg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-768x560.jpg 768w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-1536x1119.jpg 1536w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-274x200.jpg 274w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-380x277.jpg 380w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-343x250.jpg 343w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-100x73.jpg 100w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust-60x44.jpg 60w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/in-vehicle-ai-stakeholders-trust.jpg 1821w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The research identified several key areas where AI could provide significant value across the automotive industry&#8217;s value chain, including pattern recognition for quality management, enhanced data management capabilities, AI-driven decision-making systems, and improved customer service through AI-powered communication tools.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is worth OEMs and suppliers considering the opportunities offered by the new technology along their entire value chain,&#8221; explains Augustin Friedel, Senior Manager and study co-author. &#8220;However, the possible uses are diverse and implementation is quite complex.&#8221;</p>



<p>The study reveals that <a href="https://iottechnews.com/news/nearly-80-percent-us-motorists-ai-voice-assistants/">while up to 79 percent</a> of respondents express interest in AI-powered features such as driver assistance systems, intelligent route planning, and predictive maintenance, manufacturers face significant challenges in monetising these capabilities, particularly in the European market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Influencer partnerships can be great for brands looking to pump out content that promotes their products and services in an authentic way. These types of engagements can yield significant brand awareness and brand sentiment lift, but they can be risky too. Social media stars are unpredictable at the best of times, with many deliberately chasing controversy to increase their fame.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These antics don&#8217;t always reflect well on the brands that collaborate with especially attention-hungry influencers, leaving marketers no choice but to conduct careful due diligence on the individuals they work with. Luckily, that task can be made much easier thanks to <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/innovative-machine-learning-uses-transforming-business-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the evolving utility of AI</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.lightricks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lightricks</a>, a software company best known for its AI-powered video and image editing tools, is once again expanding the AI capabilities of its suite with this week’s announcement of SafeCollab. An AI-powered influencer vetting module that lives within the company’s Popular Pays creator collaboration platform, SafeCollab is a new tool for marketers that automates the vetting process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditionally, marketers have had no choice but to spend hours researching the backgrounds of influencers, looking through years’ worth of video uploads and social media posts. It’s a lengthy, manual process that can only be automated with intelligent tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SafeCollab provides that intelligence with its underlying large language models, which do the job of investigating influencers to ensure the image they portray is consistent with brand values. The LLMs perform what amounts to a risk assessment of creators’ content across multiple social media channels in minutes, searching through hours of videos, audio uploads, images and text.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In doing this, SafeCollab significantly reduces the time it takes for brand marketers to perform due diligence on the social media influencers they’re considering partnering with. Likewise, when creators opt in to SafeCollab, they make it easier for marketers to understand the brand safety implications of working together, reducing friction from campaign lifecycles.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Brands can’t take chances&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The idea here is to empower brand marketers to avoid working with creators whose content is not aligned with the brand’s values – as well as those who have a tendency to kick up a storm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such due diligence is vital, for even the most innocuous influencers can have some skeletons in their closets. A case in point is the popular lifestyle influencer Brooke Schofield, who has more than 2.2 million followers on TikTok and co-hosts the “Canceled” podcast on YouTube. With her large following, good looks and keen sense of fashion, Schofield looked like a great fit for the clothing brand Boys Lie, which collaborated with her on an exclusive capsule collection called “Bless His Heart.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Boys Lie quickly came to regret its collaboration with Schofield when a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/brooke-schofield-influencer-apology-black-creators-response-rcna165544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scandal erupted</a> in April after fans unearthed a number of years-old social media posts where she expressed racist views.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The posts, which were uploaded on X between 2012 and 2015 when Schofield was a teenager, contained a string of racist profanities and insulting jokes about Black people’s hairstyles. In one post, she vigorously defended George Zimmerman, a white American who was controversially acquitted of the murder of the Black teenager Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schofield apologized profusely for her posts, admitting that they were “very hurtful” while stressing that she’s a changed person, having had time to “learn and grow and formulate my own opinions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Boys Lie decided it had no option but to drop its association with Schofield. After a statement on Instagram saying it’s “working on a solution,” the company followed by quietly withdrawing the clothing collection they had previously collaborated on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Accelerating due diligence&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If the marketing team at Boys Lie had access to a tool like SafeCollab, they likely would have uncovered Schofield’s controversial posts long before commissioning the collaboration. The tool, which is a part of Lightricks’ influencer marketing platform Popular Pays, is all about helping brands to automate their due diligence processes when working with social media creators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By analyzing years of creators’ histories of posts across platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, it can check everything they’ve posted online to make sure there’s nothing that might reflect badly on a brand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brands can define their risk parameters, and the tool will quickly generate an accurate risk assessment evaluation, so they can confidently choose the influencers they want to work with, safe in the knowledge that their partnerships are unlikely to spark any backlash.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="744" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-1024x744.png" alt="" class="wp-image-16379" style="width:512px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-1024x744.png 1024w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-300x218.png 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-768x558.png 768w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-275x200.png 275w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-380x276.png 380w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-344x250.png 344w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-100x73.png 100w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-60x44.png 60w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image.png 1051w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Without a platform like SafeCollab, the task of performing all of this due diligence falls on the shoulders of marketers, and that means spending hours trawling through each influencer’s profiles, checking everything and anything they’ve ever said or done to ensure there’s nothing in their past that the brand would rather not be associated with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we consider that the scope of work might include audio voiceovers, extensive comment threads and frame-by-frame analyses of video content, it’s a painstaking process that never really ends. After all, the top influencers have a habit of churning out fresh content every day. Careful marketers have no choice but to continuously monitor what they’re posting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond initial history scans, SafeCollab’s real-time monitoring algorithms assume full responsibility, generating instant alerts to any problematic content, such as posts that contain graphic language, inappropriate images, promote violence or drug and alcohol use, mention violence, or whatever else the brand deems to be unsavory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AI’s expanding applications&nbsp;</h2>



<p>With the launch of SafeCollab, Lightricks is demonstrating yet another use case for generative AI. The company first made a name for itself as a developer of AI-powered video and image editing apps, including Photoleap, Facetune and Videoleap.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latter app incorporates AI-powered video filters and text-to-video generative AI functionalities. It also boasts an AI Effects feature, where users can apply specialized AI art styles to achieve the desired vibe for each video they create.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://siliconangle.com/2024/02/28/lightricks-launches-ltx-studio-advance-realism-text-video-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lightricks is also the company behind LTX Studio</a>, which is a comprehensive platform that helps advertising production firms and filmmakers to create storyboards and asset-rich pitch decks for their video projects using text-to-video generative AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With all of Lightricks’ AI apps, the primary benefit is that they save users time by automating manual work and bringing creative visions to life, and SafeCollab is a great example of that. By automating the due diligence process from start to finish, marketers can quickly identify controversial influencers they’d rather steer clear of, without spending hours conducting exhaustive research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ByteDance, the creator of TikTok, recently experienced a security breach involving an intern who allegedly sabotaged AI model training. The incident, reported on WeChat, raised concerns about the company&#8217;s security protocols in its AI department.</p>



<p>In response, <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/w/1813324433807370/?app=news_article&amp;timestamp=1729482540&amp;use_new_style=1&amp;share_token=08E369A6-498A-49A0-AE65-0A3AB19A5EFE&amp;tt_from=weixin&amp;utm_source=weixin&amp;utm_medium=toutiao_ios&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;wxshare_count=1&amp;source=m_redirect&amp;wid=1729817755484" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ByteDance clarified</a> that while the intern disrupted AI commercialisation efforts, no online operations or commercial projects were affected. According to the company, rumours that over 8,000 GPU cards were affected and that the breach resulted in millions of dollars in losses are taken out of proportion.</p>



<p>The real issue here goes beyond one rogue intern—it highlights the need for stricter security measures in tech companies, especially when interns are entrusted with key responsibilities. Even minor mistakes in high-pressure environments can have serious consequences.</p>



<p>On investigating, ByteDance found that the intern, a doctoral student, was part of the commercialisation tech team, not the AI Lab. The individual was dismissed in August.</p>



<p>According to the local media outlet Jiemian, the intern became frustrated with resource allocation and retaliated by exploiting a vulnerability in the AI development platform Hugging Face. This led to disruptions in model training, though ByteDance&#8217;s commercial Doubao model was not affected.</p>



<p>Despite the disruption, ByteDance&#8217;s automated machine learning (AML) team initially struggled to identify the cause. Fortunately, the attack only impacted internal models, minimising broader damage.</p>



<p>As context, China&#8217;s AI market, estimated to be worth $250 billion in 2023, is rapidly increasing in size, with industry leaders such as Baidu AI Cloud, SenseRobot, and Zhipu AI driving innovation. However, incidents like this one pose a huge risk to the commercialisation of AI technology, as model accuracy and reliability are directly related to business success.</p>



<p>The situation also raises questions about intern management in tech companies. Interns often play crucial roles in fast-paced environments, but without proper oversight and security protocols, their roles can pose risks. Companies must ensure that interns receive adequate training and supervision to prevent unintentional or malicious actions that could disrupt operations.</p>



<p><strong>Implications for AI commercialisation</strong></p>



<p>The security breach highlights the possible risks to AI commercialisation. A disruption in AI model training, such as this one, can cause delays in product releases, loss of client trust, and even financial losses. For a company like ByteDance, where AI drives core functionalities, these kinds of incidents are particularly damaging.</p>



<p>The issue emphasises the importance of ethical AI development and business responsibility. Companies must not only develop cutting-edge AI technology, but also ensure their security and operate responsible management. Transparency and accountability are critical for retaining trust in an era when AI plays an important role in business operations.</p>
