<p><a href="https://beam.global/">Beam </a>has deployed the world&#8217;s first AI-driven autonomous underwater vehicle for offshore wind farm inspections. The technology has already proved its mettle by inspecting jacket structures at Scotland&#8217;s largest offshore wind farm, <a href="https://www.seagreenwindenergy.com/">Seagreen</a>—a joint venture between SSE Renewables, TotalEnergies, and PTTEP.</p>



<p>The AI-powered vehicle represents a significant leap forward in marine technology and underwater robotics. Capable of conducting complex underwater inspections without human intervention, it promises to dramatically enhance efficiency and slash costs associated with underwater surveys and inspections.</p>



<p>Traditionally, offshore wind site inspections have been manual, labour-intensive processes. Beam&#8217;s autonomous solution offers a radical departure from this approach, enabling data to be streamed directly back to shore. This shift allows offshore workers to concentrate on more intricate tasks while reducing inspection timelines by up to 50%, resulting in substantial operational cost savings.</p>



<p>Brian Allen, CEO of Beam, said: &#8220;We are very proud to have succeeded in deploying the world&#8217;s first autonomous underwater vehicle driven by AI. Automation can revolutionise how we carry out inspection and maintenance of offshore wind farms, helping to reduce both costs and timelines.&#8221;</p>



<p>Beyond improved efficiency, Beam&#8217;s technology elevates the quality of inspection data and facilitates the creation of 3D reconstructions of assets alongside visual data. This deployment marks a crucial step in Beam&#8217;s roadmap for autonomous technology, with plans to extend this AI-driven solution across its fleet of DP2 vessels, ROVs, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) throughout 2025 and 2026.</p>



<p>&#8220;Looking ahead to the future, the potential of this technology is huge for the industry, and success in these initial projects is vital for us to progress and realise this vision. This wouldn&#8217;t be possible without forward-thinking customers like SSE Renewables who are willing to go on the journey with us,&#8221; explained Allen.</p>



<p>The Seagreen wind farm, operational since October 2023, is the world&#8217;s deepest fixed-bottom offshore wind farm. Beam&#8217;s project at Seagreen has provided crucial insights into the potential of autonomous technology for large offshore wind superstructures. The data collected by the AI-driven vehicle will support ongoing operational reliability at the site, offering valuable information on areas such as marine growth and potential erosion at the foundations.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Matthew Henderson, Technical Asset Manager – Substructure and Asset Lifecycle at SSE Renewables, commented: &#8220;At SSE, we have a mantra that &#8216;if it&#8217;s not safe, we don&#8217;t do it.&#8217; Beam&#8217;s technology demonstrates that autonomous inspections can reduce the personnel we need to send offshore for planned inspections, while speeding up planned works and collecting rich data-sets to inform asset integrity planning.</p>



<p>&#8220;As we move further offshore, and into deeper waters, the ability to collect high-quality inspection data in a low-risk manner is imperative to us delivering our Net Zero Acceleration Programme.&#8221;</p>



<p>As Beam prepares to roll out its AI-driven inspection technology across its fleet in 2025 and 2026, this deployment aligns with the company&#8217;s mission to revolutionise offshore wind operations by making them more efficient and cost-effective—further supporting the global energy transition.</p>



<p>The success of this AI-powered underwater vehicle at Seagreen wind farm not only demonstrates the potential of autonomous technology in offshore wind inspections but also sets a new standard for safety, efficiency, and data quality in the industry. Such innovations will play a crucial role in ensuring the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of offshore wind energy.</p>

<p>SAS, a specialist in data and AI solutions, has unveiled what it describes as a “game-changing approach” for organisations to tackle business challenges head-on.</p>



<p>Introducing lightweight, industry-specific AI models for individual licence, SAS hopes to equip organisations with readily deployable AI technology to productionise real-world use cases with unparalleled efficiency.</p>



<p>Chandana Gopal, research director, Future of Intelligence, IDC, said: “SAS is evolving its portfolio to meet wider user needs and capture market share with innovative new offerings,</p>



<p>“An area that is ripe for SAS is productising models built on SAS’ core assets, talent and IP from its wealth of experience working with customers to solve industry problems.”</p>



<p>In today’s market, the consumption of models is primarily focused on large language models (LLMs) for generative AI. In reality, LLMs are a very small part of the modelling needs of real-world production deployments of AI and decision making for businesses. With the new offering, SAS is moving beyond LLMs and delivering industry-proven deterministic AI models for industries that span use cases such as fraud detection, supply chain optimization, entity management, document conversation and health care payment integrity and more.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional AI implementations that can be cumbersome and time-consuming, SAS’ industry-specific models are engineered for quick integration, enabling organisations to operationalise trustworthy AI technology and accelerate the realisation of tangible benefits and trusted results.</p>



<p><strong>Expanding market footprint</strong></p>



<p>Organisations are facing pressure to compete effectively and are looking to AI to gain an edge. At the same time, staffing data science teams has never been more challenging due to AI skills shortages. Consequently, businesses are demanding agility in using AI to solve problems and require flexible AI solutions to quickly drive business outcomes. SAS’ easy-to-use, yet powerful models tuned for the enterprise enable organisations to benefit from a half-century of SAS’ leadership across industries.</p>



<p>Delivering industry models as packaged offerings is one outcome of SAS’ commitment of $1 billion to AIpowered industry solutions. As outlined in the May 2023 announcement, the investment in AI builds on SAS’ decades-long focus on providing packaged solutions to address industry challenges in banking, government, health care and more.</p>



<p>Udo Sglavo, VP for AI and Analytics, SAS, said: “Models are the perfect complement to our existing solutions and SAS Viya platform offerings and cater to diverse business needs across various audiences, ensuring that innovation reaches every corner of our ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“By tailoring our approach to understanding specific industry needs, our frameworks empower businesses to flourish in their distinctive Environments.”</p>



<p><strong>Bringing AI to the masses</strong></p>



<p>SAS is democratising AI by offering out-of-the-box, lightweight AI models – making AI accessible regardless of skill set – starting with an AI assistant for warehouse space optimisation. Leveraging technology like large language models, these assistants cater to nontechnical users, translating interactions into optimised workflows seamlessly and aiding in faster planning decisions.</p>



<p>Sgvalo said: “SAS Models provide organisations with flexible, timely and accessible AI that aligns with industry challenges.</p>



<p>“Whether you’re embarking on your AI journey or seeking to accelerate the expansion of AI across your enterprise, SAS offers unparalleled depth and breadth in addressing your business’s unique needs.”</p>



<p>The first SAS Models are expected to be generally available later this year.</p>

<p>The UK Government has launched a £1.5 million programme to support the use of AI to reduce carbon emissions.</p>



<p>“The UK is one of the world’s most advanced AI economies, and AI technology is already having a transformative impact on our economy and society,” said UK Science Minister George Freeman.</p>



<p>“But there is tremendous potential to do more.”</p>



<p>The AI for Decarbonisation programme is part of the wider £1 billion <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/net-zero-innovation-portfolio">Net Zero Innovation Portfolio</a> that aims to accelerate the commercialisation of low-carbon technologies, systems and business models.</p>



<p>AI for Decarbonisation will consist of two initial stages:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stage one</strong> will provide up to £500,000 of funds to create a virtual centre of excellence on AI innovation and decarbonisation through March 2025.</li>



<li><strong>Stage two</strong> is where the remaining £1 million will be used to fund innovative AI-powered decarbonisation projects.</li>
</ul>



<p>The AI for Decarbonisation programme offers an exciting opportunity to leverage and develop the UK’s outstanding expertise in the field,” adds Freeman.</p>



<p>“Putting this rapidly-evolving technology into action will enable us to save energy costs for businesses and households, create high-value, skilled jobs, and kickstart millions of pounds of private investment while supporting our net-zero targets.”</p>



<p>The UK is seeking to increase its energy independence following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the weaponisation of supplies.</p>



<p>New energy infrastructure to increase supply will take a long time to build, so reducing demand in the meantime is vital. Improving the insulation of homes and businesses while using technologies like AI to optimise processes are two leading solutions.</p>



<p>Specifically encouraged to bid for funding are AI projects that enable a faster transition to renewable energy, decarbonise industry by improving energy productivity and fuel switching, and decrease emissions in the agricultural sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The programme opens for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/artificial-intelligence-for-decarbonisation-innovation-programme">applications</a> on 22 November 2022 and closes on 19 January 2022.</p>

<p>Google has pledged to no longer build AIs for the fossil fuel industry as it further distances itself from controversial developments.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/reports/oil-in-the-cloud/">report</a> from Greenpeace earlier this month exposed Google as being one of the top three developers of AI tools for the fossil fuel industry. Greenpeace found AI technologies boost production levels by as much as five percent.</p>



<p>In an interview with CUBE’s John Furrier, the leader of Google’s CTO office, Will Grannis, said that Google will “no longer develop artificial intelligence (AI) software and tools for oil and gas drilling operations.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Will Grannis, Google Cloud | CUBE Conversation, May 2020" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f14xGesaz9o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The pledge from Google Cloud is welcome, but it must be taken in a wider context.</p>



<p>In 2019, Google Cloud’s revenue from oil and gas was approximately $65 million. A hefty sum, but less than one percent of all Google Cloud revenues. Furthermore, Google Cloud’s revenue from oil and gas decreased by about 11 percent despite overall revenue growing by 53 percent.</p>



<p>While Google Cloud’s revenue from the oil and gas industry was declining, the public’s intolerance towards big polluters is increasing. The reputational damage caused to Google of continuing its relationship with polluters would likely have been more costly over the long-term.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time Google has cut-off an AI-related relationship with a controversial industry to preserve its reputation.</p>



<p>Back in 2018, Google was forced into ending a contract with the Pentagon called Project Maven to build AI technologies for drones. Over 4,000 Google employees <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-employees-letter-urges-sundar-pichai-end-pentagon-ai-contract-2018-4">signed a petition</a> demanding their management cease the project and never again “build warfare technology.”</p>



<p>Following the Project Maven backlash, Google CEO Sundar Pichai promised in<a href="https://www.blog.google/topics/ai/ai-principles/"> a blog post</a> the company will not develop technologies or weapons that cause harm, or anything which can be used for surveillance violating “internationally accepted norms” or “widely accepted principles of international law and human rights”.</p>



<p>Back in January, Pichai <a href="http://artificialintelligence-news.com/2020/01/21/google-ceo-sensible-ai-regulation-limit-potential/">called for</a> sensible AI regulation that does not limit the potential societal benefits.</p>



<p>PAX, a Dutch NGO, <a href="http://artificialintelligence-news.com/2019/08/22/report-companies-amazon-microsoft-world-risk-ai/">ranked</a> Google among the safest companies developing AI while slamming rivals such as Amazon and Microsoft for being among the “highest risk” tech firms in the world.</p>

<p>The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has been described, <a href="https://iottechnews.com/news/2020/apr/22/how-earthsense-believes-in-iot-technologies-to-improve-air-quality-amid-covid-19-intervention/">in the words of one executive</a> in the air pollution space, as &#8216;the biggest single global intervention you will ever see.&#8217; Cars almost entirely remain in their garages; commercial aeroplanes lay dormant.</p>



<p>When the crisis ends, it will in some ways be a statistician&#8217;s dream. The amount of data which will be able to be extrapolated will be huge, for both scientists and businesses working in this field.</p>



<p>One such business is <a href="https://getairband.co.uk/">Airband Technologies</a>. The UK- based company urges businesses, consumers and governments to &#8216;take the cleaner path&#8217; through a smart, wearable air sensor. The sensor aims to help monitor air pollution and use intelligent routing with real-time data.</p>

<p><em>AI News</em> caught up with Anton Fedotov (left), co-founder of Airband Technologies, to discuss his company&#8217;s vision for cleaner air, as well as the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies being employed to make it happen.</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p><strong>AI News: Hi Anton. Tell me about your career to date and role and responsibilities at Airband?</strong></p>



<p>Anton Fedotov: I began Airband with a group of co-founders a little over a year ago. We began with an idea, and have spent the year working hard on developing it into something real and physical. Throughout that time, I have been leading the process as CEO of the company &#8211; I am involved both in the development of our product, as well as the development of our business, including reaching out and finding prospective investors and clients.</p>



<p><strong>AI: How did the concept for Airband come about?</strong></p>



<p>AF: Our lead engineer was doing research on a project about air pollution, which led him to realise the sheer lack of data which is out there &#8211; there is almost nothing aside from a few stationary monitoring sites spread out across larger city. Even data which can be purchased comes from modelling the spread starting from a relatively small dataset. Seeing the development of IoT, crowdsourced, and wearable technologies was our inspiration for a wearable air sensor, which can contribute to a massive granular dataset and help solve the pollution problem.</p>



<p><strong>AI: Tell us about Airband’s wearable air pollution monitor and how AI technologies are being used for it?</strong></p>



<p>AF: Our wearable pollution monitor is a revolutionary device which measures the quality of the air around the user, rather than a fixed space. It provides personalised pollution readings for the area and for the day to people, and it helps employers keep track of and manage their employees’ exposure for high-risk jobs. Airband makes use of AI to maximise sensor potential and extrapolate data, as well as maintaining calibration across the network. Finally, our predictive AQI technology uses AI to predict air quality in gaps of the network, making it the most detailed map of air pollution ever.</p>



<p><strong>AI: What are some of the partnerships Airband is putting together with other companies in this space and how important are partnerships in achieving your goals?</strong></p>



<p>AF: Airband is always on the lookout for partnerships, which will be fundamental to achieving our goals. We are looking at partnerships with service and hardware providers in the IoT sphere to help us develop and deploy both our product and future products across industries. We also are looking for partners in the data science sphere in order to maximise the potential of the data we collect, and help complement our dataset with existing monitoring solutions.</p>



<p><strong>AI: What other initiatives are interesting to you in the green tech space and why?</strong></p>



<p>AF: There are many amazing initiatives in the green tech space which are going on at the moment &#8211; some companies are aiming to directly reduce pollution by creating air “Scrubbers” which could serve to clean up the air around busy streets. Other companies are working on making plastics recyclable or even entirely bio-degradable. Perhaps one of the most interesting angles is the companies bringing easier choices to environmentally minded consumers, by providing either information or alternatives when buying reusable products or travelling.</p>



<p><strong>AI: What can we expect from Airband (on the basis of business as usual) for the next 12 months and beyond?</strong></p>



<p>AF: In the next 12 months, Airband hopes to deliver to initial business clients for businesses interested in protecting their employees. The development of our product and data network will be ongoing, and we should be able to start generating meaningful data, showcasing the utility of our product. Over the next 2-3 years, we hope to also expand into the consumer sector, and make the wearable air quality sensor available for all, at an affordable price.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The US Department of Energy (DOE) has decided to
provide funds up to $40 million over a three-year period for new research in
data, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning to address the
challenges associated with issues related to data production and management at
DOE scientific user facilities.</p>



<p>Dr. Chris Fall, Director of DOE’s Office of Science,
said: “Major scientific facilities at our DOE national laboratories are
generating vast and growing amounts of data for researchers every day.
Artificial intelligence and machine learning hold out new promise for managing
this wealth of data as well as improving facility operations and aiding in
experimental design.”</p>



<p>Proposals are likely to cover a wide variety of
different challenges, including extracting information from complex data sets,
managing facility operations in real-time, and optimising experiments through
the creation of virtual laboratory environments, among other topics. The
funding opportunity focuses on 18 DOE Office of Science user facilities,
comprising of particle accelerators, accelerator test facilities, x-ray light
sources, neutron scattering sources, and nanoscale science research centres, overseen
by three major programme offices: basic energy sciences, high energy physics,
and nuclear physics.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2020/2/ai-network-management-energy-costs">latest Ericsson Mobility Report</a>,
 data volumes in mobile networks are increasing at an exceptional rate 
and mobile data traffic is expected to grow fourfold by 2025, reaching 
up to 160 exabytes per month. This seems interesting and in fact offers 
all sorts of opportunities for communications service providers; 
however, there is a potential disadvantage of this rapidly increasing 
data traffic due to the impact on energy consumption and carbon 
footprint of mobile networks. But AI has the ability to solve this 
problem, Ericsson notes, as when deployed, communications service 
providers will be able to realise energy efficiencies on the radio 
network proactively. The technology does not just address site-related 
energy savings, but also operational efficiencies.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has gone beyond the way of the buzzword, all hype and no substance. Indeed, the technology is being increasingly seen in the enterprise as important in concert with other technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and <a href="http://edgecomputing-news.com/">edge computing</a>. </p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.enterprise-cio.com/news/2019/may/14/iot-ai-and-blockchain-all-key-digital-transformation-ensure-you-get-millennial-view/">report from KPMG last month</a> explored how
artificial intelligence would look to influence business. Among millennial
respondents, AI came out on top as the biggest technological priority, ahead of
IoT and 5G. Yet among those polled who said they were business leaders, it was
less of a priority compared with robotic process automation (RPA). The report
noted, however, that investing in RPA can be seen as a smoother route to future
AI investment.</p>



<p>IT giant Infosys offers many opportunities for companies looking to invest in artificial intelligence to improve workplace productivity as well as enhance the customer experience. The company notes that customers are at different stages of their journeys depending on sector and use case; and that therefore a more nuanced approach is required.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://d3c9z94rlb3c1a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/06/drnrsrinivasa.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5729" width="162" height="162" srcset="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/drnrsrinivasa.jpg 323w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/drnrsrinivasa-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/drnrsrinivasa-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/drnrsrinivasa-80x80.jpg 80w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 162px) 100vw, 162px" /></figure></div>



<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://www.ai-expo.net/europe/">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> event in Amsterdam later this month, <em>AI News</em> caught up with Dr. N. R. Srinivasa Raghavan, Chief Data Scientist, Data and Analytics at Infosys <em>(left)</em>, to discuss the initiatives the company is putting together, as well as the industries set to benefit most long-term.</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>AI News: Tell us about the initiatives Infosys is putting
together in the realm of artificial intelligence – and what have customers been
saying?</p>



<p><em>NR: Infosys is developing several industry-oriented AI solutions, frameworks, and workbenches that can help solve business problems. Specifically, AI is being positioned for enhancing the productivity of day to day operations of our clients through automation, enable decision making at tactical and operational levels, and for better customer experience.</em> </p>



<p><em>Our customers are at different stages of embracing AI. Depending on their needs, Infosys is able to craft solutions driven by a global team of experts in data sciences and AI, and help deploy these solutions at enterprise scale. </em></p>



<p>AI: Do you agree that many companies/vendors are using
‘AI-washing’ (much in the same way as cloud-washing years ago) and overplaying
their artificial intelligence capabilities? If so – what does this mean for
users and the industry at large?</p>



<p><em>NR: We believe it is not as easy to be deceptive in AI as in cloud. AI is more of an outcome heavy tech than cloud, which is more of an infrastructure play. Therefore, one can verify if indeed pattern matching and predictive science of AI is behind any software. Also, the expertise of resources working on AI projects is discernible in the quality of the output. </em></p>



<p><em>Nonetheless, there is possibly AI-washing in some very narrow areas like automation. It calls for better validations and governance to be put in place to weed these out.</em></p>



<p>AI: Which industries do you think are going to benefit most
long-term from these kinds of technologies? How important is it that several
emerging technologies – artificial intelligence, edge computing, blockchain –
can all talk to each other and make each other better to provide greater
business outcomes?</p>



<p><em>NR: Banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), retail, consumer product goods and logistics (RCL), and services, utilities, resources and energy (SURE), in that order. </em></p>



<p><em>While AI and edge computing need to work in synchronization for cases like real time predictions, integration with blockchain will be essential in the data layers of AI. Especially where the reliability, traceability and ‘sovereignty’ of data that is feeding AI is concerned.</em></p>



<p>AI: What is the most exciting use case you have seen with
artificial intelligence to date? (can be business or consumer)</p>



<p><em>NR: AI for consumer experience, AI in risk/fraud detection, AI for predictive maintenance, AI for security and AI for business functions like HR, Finance etc. These will typically be cases where there is rich and reliable data available for the AI models to work upon, as well as areas where there is executive ownership and sponsorship.</em></p>



<p>AI: What advice would you give to companies looking to
embark upon or modify their digital transformation initiatives?</p>



<p><em>NR: AI is largely seen as the harbinger for an automated/human-augmented workplace. It is therefore essential to have AI experts to be part of the blue printing for the next-gen digital enterprises. AI cannot be telescoped into digital transformation programs in large enterprises. It is no more a commodity tech, but a strategic one.</em></p>



<p>AI: What are you looking forward to most at the AI &amp; Big
Data Expo and what will you be looking to tell attendees while there?</p>



<p><em>NR: We are looking forward to hearing from other participants on their success and learnings in implementing AI within Big Data context. We are eager to share our own experience in pushing the frontiers for AI and its adoption within enterprise settings.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Plenty of funding is currently swirling around in the field of artificial intelligence across various sectors; take the £84 million announced earlier this month by the UK government around AI, robotics research and smart energy innovation, as well as $2 billion<a href="https://d3c9z94rlb3c1a.cloudfront.net/2018/10/09/darpa-2bn-ai-projects-yours/"> committed by DARPA</a>. Three of the latest funding round announcements showcase a wide range of solutions, from energy to healthcare.</p>
<p>US-based AI semiconductor manufacturer <a href="https://www.syntiant.com/">Syntiant</a> raised $25 million (£19.5m) in its latest series B funding round that was led by Microsoft Corp.’s venture fund: M12. Strategic investors like Amazon Alexa Fund, Applied Ventures, Intel Capital, Motorola Solutions Venture Capital and Robert Bosch Venture Capital were also part of this fundraiser. At this event, Syntiant also announced that it is expanding its board to five members by appointing Samir Kumar, managing director of M12, and Bret Johnsen, CFO of Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX). He will serve as an independent director.</p>
<p>Syntiant is developing semiconductor solutions designed from the ground up for deep learning inference. Syntiant’s neural decision processors (NDPs) use an analogue neural network offers orders of magnitude lower power by extreme memory efficiency along with massively parallel computation with modest precision. This is done without the constraints of legacy processor architectures. The company enables always-on deep learning inference in battery-powered devices that are ideal for applications like hearing aids and IoT, smart speakers and mobile phones, etc.</p>
<p>Canadian language translation services provider <a href="https://www.knowtions.com/">Knowtions Research</a> also raised $5 million (£3.9m) in series A funding round led by Information Venture Partners, with participation from Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund. Knowtions intends to help health insurers in a time when the rapidly increasing healthcare costs are threatening to make insurance policies less affordable for people. The company wants to reverse this trend and is working towards transformation of such health insurers with the power of AI.</p>
<p>Knowtions has developed an AI platform, called Lydia, which helps health insurers unlock and use predictive insights in unusable health data. It learns how people seek medical care globally to make predictions on fraudulent behaviour and health risks. Insurers can use these predictions to create AI-assisted workflows that automate claims processing and personalise customer experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.grid4c.com/">Grid4C</a>, an Israeli developer of AI and machine learning solutions for the energy industry, has also raised a $5 million led by ICV &#8212; a venture capital firm focused on industrial technology, backed by French energy giant ENGIE and other leading utilities in Europe and in Asia. iAngels and AxessVentures were also among the list of investors.</p>
<p>The company is working with the leading utility companies across the world, delivering billions of predictions for millions of smart meters every day. The company’s analytics solutions leverage the ability of AI and data science to offer utilities with granular predictions and actionable insights for their operations and customer-facing applications.</p>
