										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency">MHRA</a>) has announced the selection of five healthcare technologies for its ‘AI Airlock’ scheme.</p>



<p>AI Airlock aims to refine the process of regulating AI-driven medical devices and help fast-track their safe introduction to the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) and patients in need.</p>



<p>The technologies chosen for this scheme include solutions targeting cancer and chronic respiratory diseases, as well as advancements in radiology diagnostics. These AI systems promise to revolutionise the accuracy and efficiency of healthcare, potentially driving better diagnostic tools and patient care.</p>



<p>The AI Airlock, as described by the MHRA, is a “sandbox” environment—an experimental framework designed to help manufacturers determine how best to collect real-world evidence to support the regulatory approval of their devices.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional medical devices, AI models continue to evolve through learning, making the establishment of safety and efficacy evidence more complex. The Airlock enables this exploration within a monitored virtual setting, giving developers insight into the practical challenges of regulation while supporting the NHS’s broader adoption of transformative AI technologies.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Safely enabling AI healthcare innovation&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Laura Squire, the lead figure in MedTech regulatory reform and Chief Officer at the MHRA, said: “New AI medical devices have the potential to increase the accuracy of healthcare decisions, save time, and improve efficiency—leading to better outcomes for the NHS and patients across all healthcare settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But we need to be confident that AI-powered medical devices introduced into the NHS are safe, stay safe, and perform as intended through their lifetime of use.”</p>



<p>Squire emphasised that the AI Airlock pilot allows collaboration “in partnership with technology specialists, developers and the NHS,” facilitating the exploration of best practices and accelerating safe patient access to innovative solutions.</p>



<p>Government representatives have praised the initiative for its forward-thinking framework.</p>



<p>Karin Smyth, Minister of State for Health, commented: “As part of our 10-Year Health Plan, we’re shifting NHS care from analogue to digital, and this project will help bring the most promising technology to patients.</p>



<p>“AI has the power to revolutionise care by supporting doctors to diagnose diseases, automating time-consuming admin tasks, and reducing hospital admissions by predicting future ill health.”</p>



<p>Science Minister Lord Vallance lauded the AI Airlock pilot as “a great example of government working with businesses to enable them to turn ideas into products that improve lives.” He added, “This shows how good regulation can facilitate emerging technologies for the benefit of the UK and our economy.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Selected technologies&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The deployment of AI-powered medical devices requires meeting stringent criteria to ensure innovation, patient benefits, and regulatory challenge readiness. The five technologies selected for this inaugural pilot offer vital insights into healthcare’s future:&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Lenus Stratify</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are among those who stand to benefit significantly from AI innovation. Lenus Stratify, developed by Lenus Health, analyses patient data to predict severe lung disease outcomes, reducing unscheduled hospital admissions. The system empowers care providers to adopt earlier interventions, affording patients an improved quality of life while alleviating NHS resource strain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Philips Radiology Reporting Enhancer</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Philips has integrated AI into existing radiology workflows to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of critical radiology reports. This system uses AI to prepare the “Impression” section of reports, summarising essential diagnostic information for healthcare providers. By automating this process, Philips aims to minimise workload struggles, human errors, and miscommunication, creating a more seamless diagnostic experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Federated AI Monitoring Service (FAMOS)</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>One recurring AI challenge is the concept of “drift,” when changing real-world conditions impair system performance over time. Newton’s Tree has developed FAMOS to monitor AI models in real time, flagging degradation and enabling rapid corrections. Hospitals, regulators, and software developers can use this tool to ensure algorithms remain high-performing, adapting to evolving circumstances while prioritising patient safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>OncoFlow Personalised Cancer Management</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Targeting the pressing healthcare challenge of reducing waiting times for cancer treatment, OncoFlow speeds up clinical workflows through its intelligent care pathway platform. Initially applied to breast cancer protocols, the system later aims to expand across other oncology domains. With quicker access to tailored therapies, patients gain increased survival rates amidst mounting NHS pressures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="5" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>SmartGuideline</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Developed to simplify complex clinical decision-making processes, SmartGuideline uses large-language AI trained on official NICE medical guidelines. This technology allows clinicians to ask routine questions and receive verified, precise answers, eliminating the ambiguity associated with current AI language models. By integrating this tool, patients benefit from more accurate treatments grounded in up-to-date medical knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Broader implications&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The influence of the AI Airlock extends beyond its current applications. The MHRA expects pilot findings, due in 2025, to inform future medical device regulations and create a clearer path for manufacturers developing AI-enabled technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The evidence derived will contribute to shaping post-Brexit UKCA marking processes, helping manufacturers achieve compliance with higher levels of transparency. By improving regulatory frameworks, the UK could position itself as a global hub for med-tech innovation while ensuring faster access to life-saving tools.</p>



<p>The urgency of these developments was underscored earlier this year in Lord Darzi’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-investigation-of-the-nhs-in-england">review</a> of health and care. The report outlined the “critical state” of the NHS, offering AI interventions as a promising pathway to sustainability. The work on AI Airlock by the MHRA addresses one of the report’s major recommendations for enabling regulatory solutions and “unlocking the AI revolution” for healthcare advancements.</p>



<p>While being selected into the AI Airlock pilot does not indicate regulatory approval, the technologies chosen represent a potential leap forward in applying AI to some of healthcare’s most pressing challenges. The coming years will test the potential of these solutions under regulatory scrutiny.</p>



<p>If successful, the initiative from the MHRA could redefine how pioneering technologies like AI are adopted in <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/categories/ai-industries/healthcare/">healthcare</a>, balancing the need for speed, safety, and efficiency. With the NHS under immense pressure from growing demand, AI’s ability to augment clinicians, predict illnesses, and streamline workflows may well be the game-changer the system urgently needs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the past year, we’ve seen remarkable achievements across AI-assisted cancer diagnosis as more and more clinicians test, use and integrate AI companions into daily practice.</p>



<p>Skin cancer is no exception, and we expect AI diagnostic tools to be widely implemented across this clinical arena in the future. What does AI assistance look like for skin cancer? A 2024 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01031-w">study</a> led by researchers at Stanford Medicine compared the performance of clinicians diagnosing at least one skin cancer with and without deep learning-based AI assistance. In an experimental environment, clinicians without AI assistance achieved an average sensitivity of 74.8% while for AI-assisted clinicians, sensitivity was around 81.1%.</p>



<p>What’s intriguing is AI helped medical professionals at all levels, with the largest improvement seen among non-dermatologists.</p>



<p><strong>AI for skin cancer can impact behaviour change</strong></p>



<p>Cancer is on the rise among younger people. According to a study published in <a href="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049">BMJ Oncology,</a>&nbsp;the number of under-50s worldwide being diagnosed with cancer has risen by nearly 80% in three decades. And, over the last decade melanoma skin cancer incidence rates have increased by <a href="https://www.bupa.com/news/press-releases/2020/bupa-launches-skin-assessment-service">almost two-fifths</a>&nbsp;(38%) with Spain seeing a steady incidence increase of<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10968947/#:~:text=An%20estimated%20147%2C823%20cases%20of,3.4%20to%205.3)%20nonsignificant)."> 2.4% during this time</a>.</p>



<p>If detected early enough, skin cancer is easily treated and prognosis is very good. But busy lives and competing concerns mean fewer people are getting checked out, resulting in delays to diagnosis and treatment, which is dramatically changing the survival rates. Those who do, often wait to speak to a doctor. In fact, new research from Bupa, <em>Attitudes Towards Digital Healthcare,</em> indicates only 9% of people would immediately go to get a mole they were concerned about examined by a professional.</p>



<p>However, the same research found that if people were able to have a mole assessed by an AI-powered phone app at the time of their choosing, that percentage increases more than threefold (33%). This signifies emerging technology can have a significant impact on positive behaviour change in healthcare and improve clinical outcome of a potentially severe disease.</p>



<p><strong>Bupa now offer an at-home dermatology tool</strong></p>



<p>At Bupa, we see lots of opportunities to use AI and are exploring its use to enhance patient care, improve operational efficiency, and help our customers to live longer, healthier and happier lives. We know that people want their healthcare partner to be by their side, not just when they are sick, but supporting them constantly to keep them well.</p>



<p>That’s why we launched Blua, our digital healthcare service that’s available in over 200 countries. Blua provides access to three lifechanging healthcare innovations that drive convenience and accessibility. They are <em>virtual consultations</em> so that a customer can connect to a health professional from wherever they choose. <em>Digital health programmes</em>that allow customers to proactively manage their health and <em>remote healthcare services</em> such as prescription delivery and at home monitoring equipment.  </p>



<p>For customers in Spain, we offer an at-home dermatology assessment service through Blua. How does this work? Customers who’re worried about a skin lesion can take high resolution photos of it using their smartphone. Once taken, the photos are uploaded to Blua and using AI are compared with a database of millions of other images of skin lesions to check for signs of malignancy.</p>



<p>The tool’s algorithms are able to discern between 302 different skin pathologies. If the tool suspects that there is a cause for concern it will let the customer know to book a follow up appointment with a doctor so that it can be looked at further and preventative action can be taken if needed.</p>



<p><strong>The future of healthcare means early detection</strong></p>



<p>Digital healthcare, together with AI, is going to play a crucial role in removing the barriers that stop people from getting health concerns like moles checked out in a timely manner, promoting positive behaviour change that can save lives. This is why Blua is especially useful in today’s fast-paced world where convenience is paramount and virtual consultations and at home tests will empower individuals to prioritise their health, without the need to sacrifice their time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Google DeepMind has unveiled an AI system called AlphaProteo that can design novel proteins that successfully bind to target molecules, potentially revolutionising drug design and disease research.</p>



<p>AlphaProteo can generate new protein binders for diverse target proteins, including VEGF-A, which is associated with cancer and diabetes complications. Notably, this is the first time an AI tool has successfully designed a protein binder for VEGF-A.</p>



<p>The system&#8217;s performance is particularly impressive, achieving higher experimental success rates and binding affinities that are up to 300 times better than existing methods across seven target proteins tested:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="592" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-1024x592.jpg" alt="Chart demonstrating Google DeepMind's AlphaProteo success rate" class="wp-image-15995" srcset="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-1024x592.jpg 1024w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-768x444.jpg 768w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-346x200.jpg 346w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-380x220.jpg 380w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-350x202.jpg 350w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-100x58.jpg 100w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results-60x35.jpg 60w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-deepmind-alphaproteo-protein-binding-results.jpg 1232w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>(Credit: Google DeepMind)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Trained on vast amounts of protein data from the <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/">Protein Data Bank</a> and over 100 million predicted structures from <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/deepmind-releases-alphafold-database-nearly-all-human-protein-structures/">AlphaFold</a>, AlphaProteo has learned the intricacies of molecular binding. Given the structure of a target molecule and preferred binding locations, the system generates a candidate protein designed to bind at those specific sites.</p>



<p>To validate AlphaProteo&#8217;s capabilities, the team designed binders for a diverse range of target proteins, including viral proteins involved in infection and proteins associated with cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. The results were promising, with high binding success rates and best-in-class binding strengths observed across the board.</p>



<p>For instance, when targeting the viral protein BHRF1, 88% of AlphaProteo&#8217;s candidate molecules bound successfully in wet lab testing. On average, AlphaProteo binders exhibited 10 times stronger binding than the best existing design methods across the targets tested.</p>



<p>The system&#8217;s performance suggests it could significantly reduce the time required for initial experiments involving protein binders across a wide range of applications. However, the team acknowledges that AlphaProteo has limitations, as it was unable to design successful binders against TNFɑ (a protein associated with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.)</p>



<p>To ensure responsible development, Google DeepMind is collaborating with external experts to inform their phased approach to sharing this work and contributing to community efforts in developing best practices—including the NTI&#8217;s new <a href="https://www.nti.org/news/nti-convenes-the-first-international-ai-bio-forum/">AI Bio Forum</a>.</p>



<p>As the technology evolves, the team plans to work with the scientific community to leverage AlphaProteo on impactful biology problems and understand its limitations. They are also exploring drug design applications at Isomorphic Labs.</p>



<p>While AlphaProteo represents a significant step forward in protein design, achieving strong binding is typically just the first step in designing proteins for practical applications. There remain many bioengineering challenges to overcome in the research and development process.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Google DeepMind’s advancement holds tremendous potential for accelerating progress across a broad spectrum of research, including drug development, cell and tissue imaging, disease understanding and diagnosis, and even crop resistance to pests.</p>

<p><a href="https://paige.ai/">Paige</a> and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230907172627/en/Paige-Announces-Collaboration-with-Microsoft-to-Build-the-World%E2%80%99s-Largest-Image-Based-AI-Model-to-Fight-Cancer">Microsoft</a> have unveiled the next big breakthrough in clinical AI for cancer diagnosis and treatment: Virchow2 and Virchow2G, enhanced versions of its revolutionary AI models for cancer pathology.</p>



<p>The Virchow2 and Virchow2G models are based on an enormous dataset that Paige has accumulated. Paige has gathered more than three million pathology slides from over 800 labs across 45 countries, on which the models were trained. Such a volume of data is, unsurprisingly, highly beneficial. This data was obtained from over 225,000 patients, all de-identified to create a rich and representative dataset encompassing all genders, races, ethnic groups, and regions across the globe.</p>



<p>What makes these models truly remarkable is their scope. They cover over 40 different tissue types and various staining methods, making them applicable to a wide range of cancer diagnoses. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virchow2G</a>, with its 1.8 billion parameters, stands as the largest pathology model ever created and sets new standards in AI training, scale, and performance.</p>



<p>As Dr. Thomas Fuchs, founder and chief scientist of Paige, comments: &#8220;We&#8217;re just beginning to tap into what these foundation models can achieve in revolutionising our understanding of cancer through computational pathology.&#8221; He believes these models will significantly improve the future for pathologists, and he agrees that this technology is becoming an important step in the progression of diagnostics, targeted medications, and customised patient care.</p>



<p>Similarly, Razik Yousfi, Paige&#8217;s senior vice president of technology, states that these models are not only making precision medicine a reality but are also improving the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, and pushing the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible in pathology and patient care.</p>



<p>So, how is this relevant to cancer diagnosis today? Paige has developed a clinical AI application that pathologists can use to recognise cancer in over 40 tissue types. This tool allows potentially hazardous areas to be identified more quickly and accurately. In other words, the diagnostic process becomes more efficient and less prone to errors, even for rare cancers, with the help of this tool.</p>



<p>Beyond diagnosis, Paige has created AI modules that can benefit life sciences and pharmaceutical companies. These tools can aid in therapeutic targeting, biomarker identification, and clinical trial design, potentially leading to more successful trials and faster development of new therapies.</p>



<p>The good news for researchers is that Virchow2 is available on Hugging Face for non-commercial research, while the entire suite of AI modules is now available for commercial use. This accessibility could accelerate advancements in cancer research and treatment across the scientific community.</p>



<p>In summary, the recently introduced AI models represent a major advancement in the fight against cancer. Paige and Microsoft have chosen the right path by combining the power of data with state-of-the-art AI technologies. These companies have created new opportunities for more accurate cancer prediction, paving the way for tailored solutions and innovative research in oncology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Three hospital systems across England have begun a live clinical trial of AI technology designed to detect and grade prostate cancer. The study – known as <a href="https://www.nds.ox.ac.uk/research/verrill-pathology-group/articulate-pro">ARTICULATE PRO</a> – is being led by the University of Oxford in collaboration with <a href="https://paige.ai/">Paige</a>, a pioneer in clinical AI applications for cancer diagnosis.</p>



<p>The participating hospitals – North Bristol Trust Southmead Hospital, University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, and Oxford University NHS Foundation Trust – are now incorporating Paige&#8217;s AI technology into their standard of care. This multisite trial aims to evaluate the potential of AI to improve patient outcomes against a backdrop of rising prostate cancer cases.</p>



<p>Professor Clare Verrill, OUH Cellular Pathology Consultant, Associate Professor and Principal Investigator of ARTICULATE PRO, said &#8220;The central focus of ARTICULATE PRO is patients. We are striving towards our goal to safely and effectively ensure they benefit the most from powerful AI technology.</p>



<p>&#8220;With the multisite live use of The Paige Prostate Suite, we can systematically study benefits to patients in clinical settings.&#8221;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://paige.ai/diagnostic-ai/prostate-suite/">Prostate Suite</a> – the AI system being trialled – is designed to assist pathologists in detecting, grading, and measuring tumours in prostate biopsies and tissue samples. Pathologists at the three hospitals are assessing how this AI technology impacts their clinical decision-making, pathology service delivery, and resource utilisation in real-world settings.</p>



<p>Dr Jon Oxley, Uropathologist and Bristol lead of ARTICULATE PRO, commented: &#8220;I have studied the disease and progression of prostate cancer in clinical research for over 25 years, it is a significant advancement that Paige&#8217;s AI applications have achieved a level of validation and performance that allows safe and effective live clinical use.</p>



<p>&#8220;Using Paige Prostate Suite alongside our standard of care has the promise to increase efficiency and improve reproducibility of results for patients.&#8221;</p>



<p>The study is notable for its implementation across hospitals using different digital pathology scanners and information systems, serving distinct patient populations. This diversity allows for a comprehensive assessment of how Paige&#8217;s AI technology can best serve patients, histopathologists, and hospital systems in prostate cancer diagnosis.</p>



<p>Dr Bidisa Sinha, Uropathologist at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, added: &#8220;We believe AI can help to improve the accuracy and consistency of grading cancer and assist in detection of small areas of cancer which are easy to miss.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is world-leading research being carried out at UHCW. We are proud to be a global leader in the field of digital and computational pathology.&#8221;</p>



<p>The ARTICULATE PRO study is funded by the Accelerated Access Collaborative (AAC) Artificial Intelligence in Health and Care Award, overseen by the Department of Health and Social Care.</p>



<p>As prostate cancer rates continue to rise, the integration of AI in diagnosis could potentially lead to earlier detection, more accurate grading, and ultimately improved patient outcomes. The results of this trial could pave the way for wider adoption of AI in cancer diagnosis across the UK and beyond.</p>

<p>SoftBank Group, the Japanese technology investment firm, has announced a strategic joint venture with <a href="https://www.tempus.com/">Tempus AI</a>, a company specialising in AI-driven medical data analysis and treatment recommendations.</p>



<p>This partnership was revealed by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/2024/06/24/softbank-chief-forget-agi-asi-here-within-10-years/" rel="noreferrer noopener">SoftBank&#8217;s CEO, Masayoshi Son</a>, during a briefing in Tokyo, marking another significant move in SoftBank&#8217;s recent series of AI investments as the company ramps up its investment activities following a period of relative quiet.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, SoftBank invested approximately $200 million in Tempus during its Series G funding round, preceding Tempus&#8217;s Nasdaq listing in June. Tempus is renowned for its genomic testing services and AI-powered treatment and clinical trial recommendations in the United States, leveraging a comprehensive database of millions of patient clinical records.</p>



<p>As reported by <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/softbank-group-launches-ai-healthcare-joint-venture-with-tempus-ai-2024-06-27/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em>, the partnership is hoped to enable these advanced services to be deployed in Japan, making it one of the first non-US healthcare markets with this type of connected health capabilities.</p>



<p>&#8220;Working with Tempus, we&#8217;ll develop services at pace in Japan. With the database of 7.7 million U.S. patients, we&#8217;re at a running start,&#8221; Son said about the venture.</p>



<p>The partnership is anticipated to close in July, subject to usual closing conditions, and will involve an investment of 15 billion yen (close to $93 million) from each party.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Google&#8217;s support for Tempus AI</strong></h4>



<p>Tempus AI has also recently caught the eye of Google, an Alphabet company that is still on a spending spree to acquire and develop artificial intelligence technologies. Google&#8217;s support is crucial for Tempus, as the search giant has been a major player in deploying AI over time. This includes standout systems like AlphaGo and foundational innovations such as the transformer architecture used in ChatGPT.</p>



<p>Tempus uses AI technology to develop what it describes as &#8220;intelligent diagnostics,&#8221; which are diagnostic tests tailored specifically to the patients they apply to. The initiative is designed to improve the efficacy of existing treatments and speed up the development of new therapies.</p>



<p>On June 14, 2024, Tempus conducted its IPO on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The company&#8217;s stock fared well, surging as much as 15% during its first day of trading and closing nearly 9 per cent higher. The market capitalisation of Tempus AI reached $6 billion.</p>



<p>Google&#8217;s financial involvement with Tempus AI began in June 2020 when Tempus issued a $330 million convertible promissory note to Google as part of a cloud services agreement. Later that year, Tempus provided Google with $80 million of preferred stock to partially satisfy the original note.</p>



<p>Over the period from 2002 to 2023, revenue at Tempus AI grew by 183%. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation are improving, although it has yet to reach profitability.</p>



<p>The quality of its technology is evident from the current client base. Tempus has worked with approximately 95% of the world&#8217;s top 20 publicly traded biopharma companies. In addition to its collaborations with over 200 pharmaceutical companies, Tempus is used in over half of U.S. academic medical centres and connects with over 7,000 physicians.</p>

<p>SAS, a specialist in data and AI solutions, has unveiled what it describes as a “game-changing approach” for organisations to tackle business challenges head-on.</p>



<p>Introducing lightweight, industry-specific AI models for individual licence, SAS hopes to equip organisations with readily deployable AI technology to productionise real-world use cases with unparalleled efficiency.</p>



<p>Chandana Gopal, research director, Future of Intelligence, IDC, said: “SAS is evolving its portfolio to meet wider user needs and capture market share with innovative new offerings,</p>



<p>“An area that is ripe for SAS is productising models built on SAS’ core assets, talent and IP from its wealth of experience working with customers to solve industry problems.”</p>



<p>In today’s market, the consumption of models is primarily focused on large language models (LLMs) for generative AI. In reality, LLMs are a very small part of the modelling needs of real-world production deployments of AI and decision making for businesses. With the new offering, SAS is moving beyond LLMs and delivering industry-proven deterministic AI models for industries that span use cases such as fraud detection, supply chain optimization, entity management, document conversation and health care payment integrity and more.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional AI implementations that can be cumbersome and time-consuming, SAS’ industry-specific models are engineered for quick integration, enabling organisations to operationalise trustworthy AI technology and accelerate the realisation of tangible benefits and trusted results.</p>



<p><strong>Expanding market footprint</strong></p>



<p>Organisations are facing pressure to compete effectively and are looking to AI to gain an edge. At the same time, staffing data science teams has never been more challenging due to AI skills shortages. Consequently, businesses are demanding agility in using AI to solve problems and require flexible AI solutions to quickly drive business outcomes. SAS’ easy-to-use, yet powerful models tuned for the enterprise enable organisations to benefit from a half-century of SAS’ leadership across industries.</p>



<p>Delivering industry models as packaged offerings is one outcome of SAS’ commitment of $1 billion to AIpowered industry solutions. As outlined in the May 2023 announcement, the investment in AI builds on SAS’ decades-long focus on providing packaged solutions to address industry challenges in banking, government, health care and more.</p>



<p>Udo Sglavo, VP for AI and Analytics, SAS, said: “Models are the perfect complement to our existing solutions and SAS Viya platform offerings and cater to diverse business needs across various audiences, ensuring that innovation reaches every corner of our ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“By tailoring our approach to understanding specific industry needs, our frameworks empower businesses to flourish in their distinctive Environments.”</p>



<p><strong>Bringing AI to the masses</strong></p>



<p>SAS is democratising AI by offering out-of-the-box, lightweight AI models – making AI accessible regardless of skill set – starting with an AI assistant for warehouse space optimisation. Leveraging technology like large language models, these assistants cater to nontechnical users, translating interactions into optimised workflows seamlessly and aiding in faster planning decisions.</p>



<p>Sgvalo said: “SAS Models provide organisations with flexible, timely and accessible AI that aligns with industry challenges.</p>



<p>“Whether you’re embarking on your AI journey or seeking to accelerate the expansion of AI across your enterprise, SAS offers unparalleled depth and breadth in addressing your business’s unique needs.”</p>



<p>The first SAS Models are expected to be generally available later this year.</p>

<p>An AI tool has proven capable of detecting signs of cancer that were overlooked by human radiologists.</p>



<p>The AI tool, called Mia, was piloted alongside <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS</a> clinicians in the UK and analysed the mammograms of over 10,000 women.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the participants were cancer-free, but the AI successfully flagged all of those with symptoms of breast cancer—as well as an additional 11 cases that the doctors failed to identify. Of the 10,889 women who participated in the trial, only 81 chose not to have their scans reviewed by the AI system.</p>



<p>The AI tool was trained on a dataset of over 6,000 previous breast cancer cases to learn the subtle patterns and imaging biomarkers associated with malignant tumours. When evaluated on the new cases, it correctly predicted the presence of cancer with 81.6 percent accuracy and correctly ruled it out 72.9 percent of the time.</p>



<p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, with two million new cases diagnosed annually. While survival rates have improved with earlier detection and better treatments, many patients still experience severe side effects like lymphoedema after surgery and radiotherapy.</p>



<p>Researchers are now developing the AI system further to predict a patient&#8217;s risk of such side effects up to three years after treatment. This could allow doctors to personalise care with alternative treatments or additional supportive measures for high-risk patients.</p>



<p>The research team plans to enrol 780 breast cancer patients in a clinical trial called Pre-Act to prospectively validate the AI risk prediction model over a two-year follow-up period. The long-term goal is an AI system that can comprehensively evaluate a patient&#8217;s prognosis and treatment needs.</p>

<p>In an interview at <a href="https://www.ai-expo.net/global/">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a>, Alessandro Grande, Head of Product at <a href="https://edgeimpulse.com/">Edge Impulse</a>, discussed issues around developing machine learning models for resource-constrained edge devices and how to overcome them.</p>



<p>During the discussion, Grande provided insightful perspectives on the current challenges, how Edge Impulse is helping address these struggles, and the tremendous promise of on-device AI.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Key hurdles with edge AI adoption</h4>



<p>Grande highlighted three primary pain points companies face when attempting to productise edge machine learning models, including difficulties determining optimal data collection strategies, scarce AI expertise, and cross-disciplinary communication barriers between hardware, firmware, and data science teams.</p>



<p>&#8220;A lot of the companies building edge devices are not very familiar with machine learning,&#8221; says Grande. &#8220;Bringing those two worlds together is the third challenge, really, around having teams communicate with each other and being able to share knowledge and work towards the same goals.&#8221;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Strategies for lean and efficient models</h4>



<p>When asked how to optimise for edge environments, Grande emphasised first minimising required sensor data.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are seeing a lot of companies struggle with the dataset. What data is enough, what data should they collect, what data from which sensors should they collect the data from. And that&#8217;s a big struggle,&#8221; explains Grande.</p>



<p>Selecting efficient neural network architectures helps, as does compression techniques like quantisation to reduce precision without substantially impacting accuracy. Always balance sensor and hardware constraints against functionality, connectivity needs, and software requirements.</p>



<p>Edge Impulse aims to enable engineers to validate and verify models themselves pre-deployment using common ML evaluation metrics, ensuring reliability while accelerating time-to-value. The end-to-end development platform seamlessly integrates with all major cloud and ML platforms.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Transformative potential of on-device intelligence</h4>



<p>Grande highlighted innovative products already leveraging edge intelligence to provide personalised health insights without reliance on the cloud, such as sleep tracking with <a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura Ring</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sold over a billion pieces, and it&#8217;s something that everybody can experience and everybody can get a sense of really the power of edge AI,&#8221; explains Grande.</p>



<p>Other exciting opportunities exist around preventative industrial maintenance via anomaly detection on production lines.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Grande sees massive potential for on-device AI to greatly enhance utility and usability in daily life. Rather than just raw data, edge devices can interpret sensor inputs to provide actionable suggestions and responsive experiences not previously possible—heralding more useful technology and improved quality of life.</p>



<p>Unlocking the potential of AI on edge devices hinges on overcoming current obstacles inhibiting adoption. Grande and other leading experts provided deep insights at this year’s <a href="https://www.ai-expo.net/">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> on how to break down the barriers and unleash the full possibilities of edge AI.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to see a world where the devices that we were dealing with were actually more useful to us,&#8221; concludes Grande.</p>
