										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has raised its revenue forecast for 2024, citing <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/google-announces-uk-data-centre-meet-growing-demand-ai/">strong demand</a> for chips in AI applications. The world&#8217;s largest contract chipmaker anticipates growth slightly above the mid-20% range in US dollar terms, up from its previous estimate. This adjustment comes as TSMC reports better-than-expected profits for the second quarter of 2024.</p>



<p>During its earnings call, TSMC, according to&nbsp;<em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-set-report-strong-profit-stock-pressured-by-trump-comments-2024-07-18/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em>, also addressed speculation about potential joint ventures, particularly in the United States. The company reaffirmed its commitment to its current global expansion strategy, including significant investments in Arizona, Japan, and Europe. This stance on independent growth comes amid ongoing discussions about the worldwide distribution of semiconductor manufacturing capacity.</p>



<p>TSMC&#8217;s chairman and CEO, C.C. Wei, painted a vivid picture of the current landscape: &#8220;AI is so hot; right now everybody, all my customers, want to put AI functionality into their devices.&#8221;</p>



<p>TSMC&#8217;s success is intrinsically linked to the global AI boom, which has helped offset the tapering demand for pandemic-driven electronics. As a critical supplier to tech giants like Apple Inc and Nvidia, TSMC finds itself at the heart of the AI revolution, producing the advanced chips that power everything from smartphones to data centres.</p>



<p>It is reflected in the company&#8217;s stellar performance based on TSMC&#8217;s recent financial results, with net profit for the April-June quarter soaring to T$247.8 billion ($7.60 billion), surpassing market expectations. Despite global economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions, this robust growth comes, underscoring TSMC&#8217;s resilience and strategic positioning in the semiconductor industry.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s optimism extends into the near future, with CFO Wendell Huang projecting strong demand for TSMC&#8217;s leading-edge process technologies, particularly in smartphones and AI-related applications. This positive outlook is backed by concrete plans. TSMC adjusts its capital expenditure for the year to between $30 billion and $32 billion, signalling its commitment to expanding capacity and maintaining its technological edge.</p>



<p>However, TSMC&#8217;s journey is not without challenges. The company faces intense pressure to meet the <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/demand-for-ai-expertise-surges-by-1000/">skyrocketing demand</a> for advanced chips, with Wei describing the situation as &#8220;very, very tight.&#8221;&nbsp;TSMC is working to ramp up capacity to support customer needs through 2026 and beyond.</p>



<p>In the face of these challenges, TSMC remains committed to its global expansion strategy. The company is investing heavily in new facilities, including a $65 billion investment in three plants in Arizona and projects in Japan and potentially in Europe. This global footprint helps TSMC meet worldwide demand and positions the company strategically in an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape.</p>



<p>Interestingly, TSMC has firmly rejected the idea of a joint venture in the US despite recent comments from US political figures about Taiwan&#8217;s dominance in the chip industry. Wei reaffirmed the company&#8217;s commitment to its expansion plans, emphasizing TSMC&#8217;s independence and strategic vision.</p>



<p>As TSMC continues to push the boundaries of semiconductor technology, its impact extends far beyond its balance sheet. The company&#8217;s innovations are driving advancements in AI, powering the next generation of smart devices, and shaping the future of global technology.</p>



<p>In conclusion, TSMC&#8217;s latest financial results and optimistic forecasts paint a picture of a company at the forefront of the AI revolution. As the world increasingly relies on advanced computing power, TSMC&#8217;s role in providing the chips that make it all possible has never been more critical. With its ambitious expansion plans and unwavering focus on innovation, TSMC is not just riding the AI wave – it&#8217;s helping to create it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The semiconductor industry, which is a cornerstone of modern technology and economic prosperity, has been dealing with a serious labour shortage for some time. The skills shortage appears to be worsening, with more than one million additional skilled workers required by 2030 to meet demand in the semiconductor industry, according to <em><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology/articles/global-semiconductor-talent-shortage.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deloitte</a></em>. This pervasive issue extends beyond the US, affecting key players worldwide and threatening to impede the sector&#8217;s growth and innovation. </p>



<p>Since countries have been striving to expand their semiconductor capabilities to meet escalating global demand, particularly since the pandemic, a skilled worker shortage has emerged as a critical bottleneck, undermining efforts to maintain and advance technological leadership in this vital industry. With over two million direct employees worldwide in 2021 and more than one million extra skilled professionals required by 2030,&nbsp;<em>Deloitte</em>&nbsp;expects that more than 100,000 hires are needed every year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For background, there are less than 100,000 graduate students enrolling in electrical engineering and computer science in the US each year, as per&nbsp;<em>Deloitte’s</em>&nbsp;data. Even countries like Taiwan, South Korea, China, Japan, and Europe are&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/reshoring-semiconductor-manufacturing-addressing-workforce-challenge" rel="noreferrer noopener">facing challenges</a>&nbsp;in finding enough qualified workers to meet the demands of their rapidly expanding semiconductor sectors. For instance, Taiwan had a shortfall of over 30,000 semiconductor workers in late 2021, and South Korea is projected to face a similar shortfall over the next decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China’s shortfall is even&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47523" rel="noreferrer noopener">more severe</a>, with estimates suggesting a need for over 300,000 additional workers​, even before the current chip growth and supply chain problems. This shortage is attributed to several factors. Many nations have seen their semiconductor manufacturing expertise erode over the years as production moved offshore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the US, for example, the industry accounts for only about 12% of global chip production, with most of the advanced manufacturing know-how residing in Asia​. The lack of awareness about semiconductor careers among potential recruits also contributes to the talent gap, making it difficult to attract new workers to the field​. To top it off, the competition for semiconductor talent has also been showing signs of getting even tighter.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CHIPS Act and workforce development</strong></h3>



<p>In response to this growing issue, the US has introduced measures under the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at boosting the domestic semiconductor industry and addressing the labour shortage. The Act allocates substantial funding towards the development of the semiconductor workforce, focusing particularly on technician roles and jobs that do not require a bachelor&#8217;s degree. This is significant because about 60% of new semiconductor positions fall into these categories, according to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/new-tactics-for-new-talent-closing-us-semiconductor-labor-gaps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">McKinsey’s report</a>.​</p>



<p>The CHIPS Act, passed in 2022, promotes various initiatives to build a robust talent pipeline. However, according to a recent report by&nbsp;<em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-01/us-to-fight-labor-shortage-with-new-chips-act-worker-program?srnd=technology-vp&amp;sref=QqWIvTvt" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, the US government is intensifying its efforts to address the semiconductor labor shortage through new initiatives, under the CHIPS Act, highlighting a significant expansion of educational and training programs aimed at developing a skilled workforce tailored to the industry.</p>



<p>“The program, described as a workforce partner alliance, will use some of the $5 billion in federal funding set aside for a new National Semiconductor Technology Center. The NSTC plans to award grants to as many as 10 workforce development projects with budgets of $500,000 to $2 million,”&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg</em>&nbsp;noted.</p>



<p>The NSTC will also be launching additional application processes in the coming months, and officials will determine the total level of spending once all the proposals have been considered. All of the finance comes from the 2022 Chips and Science Act, the landmark law that set aside $39 billion in grants to boost US chipmaking, plus $11 billion for semiconductor&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-24/biden-makes-11-billion-push-to-beat-china-at-chip-research" rel="noreferrer noopener">research and development</a>, including the NSTC</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Labour shortage: A long-term problem</strong></h3>



<p>Even with all these efforts, the semiconductor industry is likely to continue facing labour shortages in the long-term. The report from McKinsey highlights that even with substantial investments in education and training, the sector will struggle to find enough skilled workers to meet its needs. </p>



<p>This is compounded by issues such as lack of career advancement opportunities, workplace inflexibility, and insufficient support, which drive many employees to leave the industry​, according to various analyses. Moreover, the competition for semiconductor talent is intensifying globally. Companies like Taiwan&#8217;s TSMC are recruiting experienced semiconductor workers from the US, India, Canada, Japan, and Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This global competition underscores the urgent need for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/reshoring-semiconductor-manufacturing-addressing-workforce-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaborative initiatives</a>&nbsp;to attract and retain skilled workers in the semiconductor industry​. After all, the labor shortage in the semiconductor industry is a complex challenge that requires multifaceted solutions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>SAS, a specialist in data and AI solutions, has unveiled what it describes as a “game-changing approach” for organisations to tackle business challenges head-on.</p>



<p>Introducing lightweight, industry-specific AI models for individual licence, SAS hopes to equip organisations with readily deployable AI technology to productionise real-world use cases with unparalleled efficiency.</p>



<p>Chandana Gopal, research director, Future of Intelligence, IDC, said: “SAS is evolving its portfolio to meet wider user needs and capture market share with innovative new offerings,</p>



<p>“An area that is ripe for SAS is productising models built on SAS’ core assets, talent and IP from its wealth of experience working with customers to solve industry problems.”</p>



<p>In today’s market, the consumption of models is primarily focused on large language models (LLMs) for generative AI. In reality, LLMs are a very small part of the modelling needs of real-world production deployments of AI and decision making for businesses. With the new offering, SAS is moving beyond LLMs and delivering industry-proven deterministic AI models for industries that span use cases such as fraud detection, supply chain optimization, entity management, document conversation and health care payment integrity and more.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional AI implementations that can be cumbersome and time-consuming, SAS’ industry-specific models are engineered for quick integration, enabling organisations to operationalise trustworthy AI technology and accelerate the realisation of tangible benefits and trusted results.</p>



<p><strong>Expanding market footprint</strong></p>



<p>Organisations are facing pressure to compete effectively and are looking to AI to gain an edge. At the same time, staffing data science teams has never been more challenging due to AI skills shortages. Consequently, businesses are demanding agility in using AI to solve problems and require flexible AI solutions to quickly drive business outcomes. SAS’ easy-to-use, yet powerful models tuned for the enterprise enable organisations to benefit from a half-century of SAS’ leadership across industries.</p>



<p>Delivering industry models as packaged offerings is one outcome of SAS’ commitment of $1 billion to AIpowered industry solutions. As outlined in the May 2023 announcement, the investment in AI builds on SAS’ decades-long focus on providing packaged solutions to address industry challenges in banking, government, health care and more.</p>



<p>Udo Sglavo, VP for AI and Analytics, SAS, said: “Models are the perfect complement to our existing solutions and SAS Viya platform offerings and cater to diverse business needs across various audiences, ensuring that innovation reaches every corner of our ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“By tailoring our approach to understanding specific industry needs, our frameworks empower businesses to flourish in their distinctive Environments.”</p>



<p><strong>Bringing AI to the masses</strong></p>



<p>SAS is democratising AI by offering out-of-the-box, lightweight AI models – making AI accessible regardless of skill set – starting with an AI assistant for warehouse space optimisation. Leveraging technology like large language models, these assistants cater to nontechnical users, translating interactions into optimised workflows seamlessly and aiding in faster planning decisions.</p>



<p>Sgvalo said: “SAS Models provide organisations with flexible, timely and accessible AI that aligns with industry challenges.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.siemens.com/">Siemens</a> are joining forces to usher in a new era of human-machine collaboration.</p>



<p>The result of the collaboration is the Siemens Industrial Copilot, a powerful AI assistant designed to enhance collaboration between humans and machines in the manufacturing sector. The tool enables rapid generation, optimisation, and debugging of complex automation code, significantly reducing simulation times from weeks to minutes.</p>



<p>At the core of this collaboration is the integration of Siemens Industrial Copilot with Microsoft Teams, connecting design engineers, frontline workers, and various teams across business functions. This integration simplifies virtual collaboration, empowering professionals with new AI-powered tools and simplifying tasks that previously required extensive time and effort.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Empowering industries with Generative AI</h4>



<p>Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO of Microsoft, expressed the immense potential of this collaboration, stating: “With this next generation of AI, we have a unique opportunity to accelerate innovation across the entire industrial sector.”</p>



<p>Siemens CEO Roland Busch echoed this sentiment; emphasising the revolutionary impact on design, development, manufacturing, and operations.</p>



<p>The companies envision AI copilots becoming integral in industries such as manufacturing, infrastructure, transportation, and healthcare.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.schaeffler.com/fork/">Schaeffler AG</a> – a leading automotive supplier – is already embracing generative AI, enabling engineers to generate reliable code for industrial automation systems. Siemens Industrial Copilot will work to reduce downtimes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Facilitating virtual collaboration</h4>



<p>To facilitate virtual collaboration, Siemens and Microsoft are launching Teamcenter for Microsoft Teams; an application that utilises generative AI to connect functions across the product design and manufacturing lifecycle.</p>



<p>This integration will allow millions of workers who previously lacked access to Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) tools to contribute seamlessly to the design and manufacturing processes.</p>



<p>The collaboration between Microsoft and Siemens looks set to be an excellent case study of how AI empowers industries and professionals, revolutionising traditional workflows and fostering global innovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Data has long been the currency on which the enterprise operates – and it goes right to the very top. Analysts and thought leaders almost universally urge the importance of the <a href="https://morgansamuels.com/the-ceos-role-in-creating-a-data-driven-culture/">CEO being actively involved in data initiatives</a>. But what gets buried in the small print is the acknowledgement that many data projects never make it to production. In 2016, Gartner assessed it at <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2016-10-04-gartner-survey-reveals-investment-in-big-data-is-up-but-fewer-organizations-plan-to-invest">only 15%.</a></p>



<p>The operationalisation of data projects has been a key factor in helping organisations turn a data deluge into a workable digital transformation strategy, and DataOps carries on from where DevOps started. But there is a further Gartner warning: organisations who lack a sustainable data and analytics operationalisation framework by 2024 will <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/430318/1035298">see their initiatives set back by up to two years</a>.</p>



<p>Operationalisation needs good orchestration to make it work, as Basil Faruqui, director of solutions marketing at <a href="https://www.bmc.com/">BMC</a>, explains. “If you think about building a data pipeline, whether you’re doing a simple BI project or a complex AI or machine learning project, you’ve got data ingestion, data storage and processing, and data insight – and underneath all of those four stages, there’s a variety of different technologies being used,” explains Faruqui. “And everybody agrees that in production, this should be automated.”</p>



<p>This is where Control-M from BMC, and in particular BMC Helix Control-M comes in. Control-M has been an integral part of many organisations for upwards of three decades, enabling businesses to run hundreds of thousands of batch jobs daily and help optimise complex operations such as supply chain management. But an increasingly complex technological landscape, across on-premises to cloud, as well as a greater usage of SaaS-based orchestration alongside consumption, made it a <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/bmc-helix-control-m-the-journey-starts-today/">no-brainer to launch BMC Helix Control-M in 2020</a>.</p>



<p>“CRMs and ERPs had been going the <a href="https://event.eu.on24.com/wcc/r/8000090115/5161C87316B03D9378130F5C5F48E673?partnerref=TFwebsite">SaaS</a> route for a while, but we started seeing more demands from the operations world for SaaS consumption models,” explains Faruqui.</p>



<p>The upshot of being a mature company – BMC was founded in 1980 – is that many customers have simply extended Control-M into more modern use cases. One example of a large organisation – and long-standing BMC customer – running an extremely complex supply chain is food manufacturer Hershey’s.</p>



<p>Apart from the time-sensitive necessity of running a business with perishable, delicate goods, the company has significantly adopted Azure, moving some existing ETL applications to the cloud, while Hershey’s operations are built on a complex SAP environment. Amid this infrastructure Control-M, in the words of Hershey’s analyst Todd Lightner, ‘literally runs our business.’</p>



<p>Faruqui returns to the stages of data ingestion, storage, processing, and insight to explain how Hershey’s would tackle a significant holiday campaign, or decide where to ship product. “It’s all data driven,” Faruqui explains. “They’re ingesting data from lots of systems of record, that are ingesting data from outside of the company; they’re pulling all that into massive data lakes where they’re running AI and ML algorithms to figure out a lot of these outcomes, and feeding into the analytics layer where business executives can look at dashboards and reports to make important decisions.</p>



<p>“They’re a really good example of somebody who has used orchestration and automation with Control-M as a strategic option for them,” adds Faruqui.</p>



<p>Yet this leads into another important point. DataOps is an important part of BMC’s strategy, but it is not the only part. “Data pipelines are dependent on a layer of applications both above and below them,” says Faruqui. “If you think about Hershey’s, trying to figure out what kind of promotion they should run, a lot of that data may be coming from SAP. And SAP is not a static system; it’s a system that is constantly being updated with workflows.</p>



<p>“So how does the data pipeline know that SAP is actually done and the data is ready for the data pipeline to start? And when they figure out the strategy, all that information needs to go back to SAP because the ordering of raw materials and everything is not going to happen in the data pipeline, it’s going to happen in ERPs,” adds Faruqui.</p>



<p>“So Control-M is able to connect across this layer, which is different from many of the tools that exist in the DataOps space.”</p>



<p>Faruqui is speaking at the <a href="https://www.ai-expo.net/europe/track/day-2-paid-optimised-data-analytics/">AI &amp; Big Data Expo Europe</a> in Amsterdam in September around how orchestration and operationalisation is the next step in organisations’ DataOps journeys. So expect not only stories and best practices on what a successful journey looks like, and how to create data pipeline orchestration across hybrid environments combining multiple clouds with on-prem, but also a look at the future – and according to Faruqui, the complexity is only going one way.</p>



<p>“I think one of the things that will continue to be challenging is there’s just lots of different tools and capabilities that are coming up in the AI and ML space,” he explains. “If you look at AWS, Azure, Google, and you go to their website, and you click on their AI/ML offerings, it is quite extensive, and every event they do, they announce new capabilities and services. So that’s on the vendor side.</p>



<p>“On the customer side, what we’re seeing is they want to rapidly test and figure out which [tools] are going to be of use to them,” Faruqui adds. “So as an orchestration vendor, and orchestration in general within DataOps, this is both the challenge and the opportunity.</p>



<p>“The challenge is you’re going to have to keep up with this because orchestration doesn’t work if you can’t integrate into something new – but the opportunity here is that our customers are asking for this.</p>



<p>“They don’t want to have to reinvent the orchestration wheel every time they go and adopt new technology.”</p>

<p>MicroAI, a Texas-based edge AI product developer, is demonstrating its Launchpad quick-start deployment tool along with its new security software at this year’s CES exhibition.</p>



<p>The world’s largest tech exhibition, CES is taking place at the Las Vegas Convention Centre (LVCC) from 5-7 January this year.</p>



<p>MicroAI has partnered with communications solutions provider iBASIS to showcase Launchpad’s management capabilities at booth 12318.</p>



<p>Using connectivity provided by iBASIS, the demo will show how Launchpad manages MicroAI software running on embedded devices and handles data from multiple sensors.</p>



<p>It will also highlight Launchpad’s ability to securely administer a fleet of SIM cards within the same portal, thus simplifying mobile device management for customers.</p>



<p>MicroAI CEO, Yasser Khan, said: &#8220;Edge-native AI enables embedded AI software to run on microcontrollers and microprocessors in endpoint devices, transforming how AI can be made available right where data is captured.</p>



<p>Launchpad provides a straightforward way for companies to manage this – opening up new opportunities across many industry sectors.&#8221;</p>



<p>The company’s new security software will also be on show at its booth. MicroAI Security uses a proprietary embedded AI algorithm to detect, alert, and visualise cyber security attacks in real-time, running directly on edge and endpoint connected devices.</p>



<p>Use cases range from standard cyber attack mitigation to protecting critical assets, IoT devices, and industrial systems.</p>



<p>MicroAI will be demonstrating how its software can be used by manufacturers at the Trump International Tower a mile west of the LVCC.</p>



<p>By collaborating with KDDI, who are providing an LTE network for the system, MicroAI will show how its software enables data from sensors in a factory to be analysed by edge AI algorithms.</p>



<p>MicroAI Grid then enables a manufacturer to link this with multiple sites around the world, automatically sharing data and intelligence.</p>

<p>Researchers <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/ai-materials-stress-strain-0422">from MIT</a> have developed an AI tool for determining the stress a material is under through analysing images.</p>



<p>The pesky laws of physics have been used by engineers for centuries to work out – using complex equations – the stresses the materials they’re working with are being put under. It’s a time-consuming but vital task to prevent structural failures which could be costly at best or cause loss of life at worst.</p>



<p>“Many generations of mathematicians and engineers have written down these equations and then figured out how to solve them on computers,” says Markus Buehler, the McAfee Professor of Engineering, director of the Laboratory for Atomistic and Molecular Mechanics, and one of the paper’s co-authors.</p>



<p>“But it’s still a tough problem. It’s very expensive — it can take days, weeks, or even months to run some simulations. So, we thought: Let’s teach an AI to do this problem for you.”</p>



<p>By employing computer vision, the AI tool developed by MIT’s researchers can generate estimates of material stresses in real-time.</p>



<p>A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) was used for the breakthrough. The network was trained using thousands of paired images—one showing the material’s internal microstructure when subjected to mechanical forces, and the other labelled with colour-coded stress and strain values.</p>



<p>Using game theory, the GAN is able to determine the relationships between the material’s appearance and the stresses it’s being put under.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="519" src="http://artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/F1.large_-1024x519.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10489" srcset="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1.large_-1024x519.jpg 1024w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1.large_-300x152.jpg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1.large_-768x389.jpg 768w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1.large_-380x192.jpg 380w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1.large_-350x177.jpg 350w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1.large_-100x51.jpg 100w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1.large_-60x30.jpg 60w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1.large_.jpg 1400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>“From a picture, the computer is able to predict all those forces: the deformations, the stresses, and so forth,” Buehler adds.</p>



<p>Even more impressively, the AI can recreate issues like cracks developing in a material that can have a major impact on how it reacts to forces.</p>



<p>Once trained, the neural network can run on consumer-grade computer processors. This makes the AI accessible in the field and enables inspections to be carried out with just a photo.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fujitsu.com/global/">Fujitsu</a> has developed an AI which can highlight abnormalities in the appearance of products to help detect issues earlier.</p>



<p>Catching problems during production enables intervention before materials are wasted—incurring direct and environmental costs. It also saves on the reputational damage and costs associated with returns/recalls after a defective product is shipped to customers.</p>



<p>The solution uses an AI model trained on images of products with abnormalities. These defects are simulated so images of actual products with issues pulled from a production line aren’t necessary.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="650" height="366" src="http://artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/fujitsu-ai-model.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10418" srcset="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fujitsu-ai-model.jpg 650w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fujitsu-ai-model-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fujitsu-ai-model-355x200.jpg 355w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fujitsu-ai-model-380x214.jpg 380w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fujitsu-ai-model-350x197.jpg 350w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fujitsu-ai-model-100x56.jpg 100w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fujitsu-ai-model-60x34.jpg 60w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></figure>



<p>Fujitsu tested its technology at its Nagano Plant, which manufactures electronic equipment, and noted a 25 percent reduction in the man-hours needed for inspecting printed circuit boards.</p>



<p>The AI is able to detect issues like frayed threads or defective wiring patterns – with “world-leading accuracy” – in products that are designed to vary individually; such as different colour carpets or electronics parts with different wiring shapes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="650" height="398" src="http://artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/Low_FujitsuDevelopsAIFig2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10419" srcset="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Low_FujitsuDevelopsAIFig2.jpg 650w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Low_FujitsuDevelopsAIFig2-300x184.jpg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Low_FujitsuDevelopsAIFig2-327x200.jpg 327w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Low_FujitsuDevelopsAIFig2-380x233.jpg 380w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Low_FujitsuDevelopsAIFig2-350x214.jpg 350w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Low_FujitsuDevelopsAIFig2-100x61.jpg 100w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Low_FujitsuDevelopsAIFig2-60x37.jpg 60w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></figure>



<p>Fujitsu’s AI achieved an AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics) score in excess of 98 percent when applied to products with variations to their normal appearance.</p>



<p>The Japanese tech giant aims to use its AI advancement for the company’s <a href="https://www.fujitsu.com/global/imagesgig5/20149_FTS_Flyer_Colmina_EN_RZ_web.pdf">COLMINA</a> (PDF) brand which aims to deliver digital transformation specifically for the manufacturing industry.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bosch.com/">Bosch</a> has partnered with Cambridge-based AI blockchain startup <a href="https://fetch.ai/">Fetch.ai</a> with the aim of transforming existing digital ecosystems using distributed ledger technologies (DLTs).</p>



<p>The global engineering giant will test key features of Fetch.ai’s testnet until the end of this month and will deploy a node on the network. The strategic engineering project between Fetch.ai and Bosch is called the Economy of Things (EoT).</p>



<p>Dr Alexander Poddey, the leading researcher for digital socio-economy, cryptology, and artificial intelligence in the EoT project, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“Our collaboration with Fetch.ai spans from the aspects of governance and orchestration of DLT-based ecosystems, multi-agent technologies to collective learning.</em></p><p><em>They share our belief that these elements are crucial to realising the economic, social, and environmental benefits of IoT technologies.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Fetch.ai’s testnet launched in October 2020 and the firm is now gearing up for its mainnet launch in March. The company has been ramping up announcements in advance of the mainnet launch and just last week announced <a href="http://artificialintelligence-news.com/2021/02/12/fetch-ai-partners-festo-decentralised-manufacturing-marketplace/">a partnership with FESTO</a> to launch a decentralised marketplace for manufacturing.</p>



<p>After the mainnet launch, Bosch intends to run nodes and applications on Fetch.ai’s blockchain network.</p>



<p>Jonathan Ward, CTO of Fetch.ai, commented:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“We have been working with Bosch for some time towards our shared vision of building open, fair, and transparent digital ecosystems. I’m delighted to be able to announce the first public step in bringing these technologies into the real world.</em></p><p><em>We’re looking forward to working further with Bosch to bring about the wide adoption of these ground-breaking innovations, which will hugely benefit consumers and businesses in many industries including automotive, manufacturing, and healthcare.” </em></p></blockquote>



<p>Fetch.ai is working on decentralised autonomous “agents” which perform real-world tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bosch is attracted to Fetch.ai’s vision of collective learning technologies and believes it can be a key enabler in their plans for AI-enabled devices—allowing AI agents to be trained which operate within smart devices while preserving users’ privacy and control of their data.</p>



<p>Fetch.ai’s vision is bold but it has the team and partnerships to pull it off. The company’s roster features talent with experience from DeepMind, Siemens, Sony, and a number of esteemed academic institutions.</p>



<p>Bosch has long expressed a keen interest in distributed ledger technologies and established multiple industry partnerships.</p>



<p>The venture capital arm of Bosch, Robert Bosch Venture-Capital, invested in the <a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a>. Bosch later patented an IOTA-based digital payments system and recently financially supported a hackathon for the DLT platform which uses a scalable DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) data structure called the ‘Tangle’ in a bid to overcome some of the historic problems with early blockchains.</p>
