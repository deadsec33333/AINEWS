										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the high-stakes world of sports betting, success hinges on the ability to predict outcomes with precision. Enter AI, which is revolutionising the industry by providing bettors with sophisticated tools to improve their odds.</p>



<p>By leveraging data analytics, machine learning, and real-time processing, AI is turning the traditional approach to sports betting on its head. This article delves into how AI algorithms are transforming sports betting, providing actual data, statistics, and insights that demonstrate their impact.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The rise of AI in sports betting</h4>



<p>Sports betting has always been a game of numbers, but the advent of AI has taken it to another level. AI algorithms can analyse vast amounts of data, recognise patterns, and make predictions with remarkable accuracy. According to a <a href="https://sportbet.one/blog/our-authors/">sportbet.one blog</a>, the AI in sports market is projected to reach $3.5 billion by 2026, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.32% from 2019 to 2026. This surge is driven by the increasing demand for data-driven decision-making in sports betting.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Predictive analytics: The heart of AI betting</h4>



<p>At the core of AI’s impact on sports betting is predictive analytics. Machine learning models, such as regression analysis, neural networks, and decision trees, are employed to analyse historical data and predict future outcomes. For instance, a study published in the Journal of Sports Analytics found that machine learning models could predict NFL game outcomes with up to 75% accuracy, significantly higher than traditional methods.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Data collection and processing</h4>



<p>AI algorithms thrive on data. They collect and process information from various sources, including past performance statistics, player conditions, weather forecasts, and even social media sentiments. According to a survey by the <a href="https://www.ijcaonline.org/">International Journal of Computer Applications</a>, AI models that incorporate diverse data sources can improve prediction accuracy by up to 20%.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Pattern recognition and anomaly detection</h4>



<p>One of AI’s greatest strengths is its ability to recognise patterns and detect anomalies. Machine learning algorithms can identify subtle trends that human analysts might miss. For example, AI can detect a player’s declining performance due to unreported injuries by analysing minute variations in their play style. This capability allows bettors to make more informed decisions and identify value bets that offer higher returns.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Real-time analysis for live betting</h4>



<p>Live betting, where odds change rapidly during a game, benefits immensely from AI’s real-time analysis capabilities. AI algorithms can process live data streams and adjust predictions on the fly. A report by the Journal of Gambling Studies found that AI-powered real-time betting systems could increase bettors’ profits by 15-25% compared to traditional methods. This advantage is particularly pronounced in fast-paced sports like basketball and soccer.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sentiment analysis: Gauging public opinion</h4>



<p>Public sentiment can significantly influence sports outcomes. AI uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyse sentiments from social media, news articles, and other textual data. For instance, during the 2018 FIFA World Cup, an AI model analysed over 10 million tweets to gauge public sentiment and accurately predicted the outcomes of 70% of the matches.</p>



<p>Sentiment analysis adds an extra layer of insight, helping bettors understand the psychological factors at play. Insights from the <a href="https://www.bookmakersreview.com/forum/threads/sportbet-one-decentralized-sports-betting-platform-%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F-ask-any-questions-%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F.53220/">BMR sports betting forum</a> show that community discussions and sentiments can also significantly influence betting decisions.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Risk management and arbitrage opportunities</h4>



<p>AI excels in managing risk by analysing the probability of various outcomes and suggesting bets that maximise returns while minimising potential losses. This includes identifying arbitrage opportunities, where discrepancies in odds between different bookmakers can be exploited.</p>



<p>According to a study by the European Journal of Operational Research, AI-driven arbitrage strategies can yield returns of up to 10% per annum, far surpassing traditional betting methods.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Automated betting systems</h4>



<p>AI-powered automated betting systems, or bots, are becoming increasingly popular. These systems can place bets based on predefined criteria and real-time data analysis, executing trades at high speed to ensure the best odds are taken advantage of. For example, an AI bot developed by the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory achieved a 25% return on investment (ROI) over a six-month period by leveraging real-time data and machine learning.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Player and team performance analysis</h4>



<p>Advanced AI models assess individual player performance and team dynamics, considering factors like injuries, player transfers, and team strategies. A study published in the IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering demonstrated that AI models could predict player performance with an accuracy of 85%, significantly aiding bettors in making informed decisions, particularly in tournaments like the <a href="http://stadiumdb.com/news/2024/05/slovakia_construction_of_arena_for_uefa_youth_championships_in_2025_is_underway_in_presov">UEFA Youth Championships</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Market analysis: Finding value bets</h4>



<p>AI algorithms analyse betting markets to identify where the best value bets are. By understanding how odds are moving and why, bettors can identify opportunities where the odds are in their favour. According to a report by Grand View Research, AI-driven market analysis can improve betting efficiency by up to 30%, making it a valuable tool for serious bettors.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bottom line<strong></strong></h3>



<p>AI algorithms are transforming sports betting by providing bettors with powerful tools to improve their odds. From predictive analytics and real-time analysis to sentiment analysis and risk management, AI is enhancing every aspect of the betting process.</p>



<p>As AI technology continues to evolve, its impact on sports betting is likely to grow, offering even more sophisticated tools for bettors. However, it’s crucial to use these tools responsibly and ethically to ensure a fair and enjoyable betting experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Artificial intelligence is transforming numerous industries, and the online slot gaming sector in the UK is no exception. The integration of AI in online slots is not just a trend but a revolution that is reshaping the gaming landscape. This advancement offers players a more personalised, secure, and engaging gaming experience. As technology evolves, the allure of <a href="https://slotcatalog.com/en-gb/no-minimum-deposit-casinos">no minimum deposit slots in the UK</a> becomes increasingly appealing, providing accessibility to a broader audience.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s delve into how AI is revolutionising online slot gaming in the UK and what this means for both players and developers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AI integration in slot machine development</h3>



<p>The development of slot machines has come a long way from their mechanical beginnings to the sophisticated digital versions we see today. AI is at the forefront of this evolution, significantly enhancing the creation and functionality of these games.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Enhanced game design</h4>



<p>AI enables developers to create more dynamic and visually appealing games. By analysing vast amounts of player data, AI can generate themes, graphics, and narratives that are tailored to the preferences of different player demographics. This means that games can be more immersive and engaging, drawing players into captivating storylines and visually stunning environments that are continually evolving based on player interactions.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Adaptive gameplay</h4>



<p>One of the most exciting applications of AI in slot machine development is the ability to adjust gameplay in real-time. AI algorithms monitor player behaviour and adapt the difficulty and features of the game accordingly. For example, if a player is struggling, the game might become slightly easier to keep them engaged, or if a player is doing exceptionally well, the game might present more challenges to maintain excitement. This adaptive gameplay ensures that players remain interested and challenged, providing a more satisfying gaming experience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Personalised player experience</h3>



<p>Personalisation is a key aspect of modern online gaming, and AI is instrumental in delivering a customised experience for each player.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Machine learning for player insights</h4>



<p>AI uses machine learning to analyse player behaviour and preferences, allowing for highly personalised game suggestions and promotional offers. By understanding what types of games a player enjoys and how they like to play, AI can recommend new games or bonuses that are most likely to appeal to them. This level of personalisation enhances the player&#8217;s experience and increases their engagement with the platform.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Customised in-game experience</h4>



<p>Beyond recommendations, AI also customises the gameplay itself. For instance, AI can adjust game mechanics, such as bonus frequencies and difficulty levels, based on individual player data. This means that each gaming session is unique and tailored to the player’s specific preferences, making the gaming experience more enjoyable and engaging.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Enhancing security and fairness</h3>



<p>Security and fairness are critical components of online gaming, and AI plays a significant role in ensuring both.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Fraud detection and prevention</h4>



<p>AI is highly effective in identifying and preventing fraudulent activities. By continuously monitoring player behavior and transaction patterns, AI can detect anomalies that may indicate fraudulent actions. When such activities are detected, AI can intervene in real-time to prevent losses and protect players and operators alike. This capability is crucial for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of online gaming platforms.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ensuring fair play</h4>



<p>Ensuring fair play is paramount in online gaming, and AI enhances this by maintaining the integrity of random number generators (RNG). AI algorithms ensure that the outcomes of slot games are truly random and free from manipulation. This transparency is essential for player trust, as it guarantees that every player has an equal chance of winning based on luck, without any external interference.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AI&#8217;s role in responsible gambling</h3>



<p>AI is also a powerful tool in promoting responsible gambling practices, helping to mitigate the risks associated with gambling addiction.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Predictive analytics for problem gambling</h4>



<p>AI can analyse playing patterns to identify behaviours that may indicate problem gambling. By using predictive analytics, AI can spot early signs of addiction, such as excessive spending or extended gaming sessions. This allows gaming platforms to intervene proactively, offering support and resources to players who may be at risk.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Intervention strategies</h4>



<p>Once potential problem gambling behavior is identified, AI can implement intervention strategies. This might include sending notifications to players about their gaming habits, providing self-assessment tools, or limiting the amount of time and money a player can spend on the platform. These strategies are designed to help players maintain a healthy relationship with gambling and prevent the escalation of problematic behaviours.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Future prospects</h3>



<p>Looking ahead, the potential of AI in the online slot gaming industry is immense. As AI technology continues to advance, we can expect even more sophisticated and personalised gaming experiences. AI-driven innovation will likely lead to entirely new types of games that we cannot yet imagine, offering unparalleled levels of engagement and excitement.</p>



<p>AI is revolutionising the online slot gaming industry in the UK, offering enhanced game design, personalised player experiences, improved security, and responsible gambling measures. As the technology continues to evolve, the future of online slot gaming looks incredibly promising, with AI playing a pivotal role in shaping this exciting landscape. For players and developers alike, the integration of AI presents endless possibilities for innovation and improvement in the world of online gaming.</p>

<p>AI is in pretty much everyone’s conversations right now, with people using it (successfully and unsuccessfully) for a vast range of different things. Let’s face it: we’ve got stars in our eyes when it comes to AI right now &#8211; but what’s it doing to one of the vast industries on our planet, the casino industry? How is it shaking up games from the core? Let’s find out!</p>



<p>Many games are being totally revolutionised by AI stepping onto the scene, so let’s get into the nitty-gritty of which games are changing, what’s happening, and how AI is leaving its footprint on this world of <a href="https://www.bodog.eu/casino">online casino games</a>!</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Personalisation in the slots</h4>



<p>First up: personalisation. AI really shines when it comes to personalising the slots, because an AI can analyse each player’s individual behaviour and start tailoring what the game shows to match. Imagine you’re playing at your favourite slot, and you get a bunch of free spins come up &#8211; but none of them are quite what you wanted and they’re just not doing it for you today. We all know that feeling of disappointment… and honestly, it gets directed at the company, because why don’t they know you better than that? Isn’t marketing meant to be good these days?</p>



<p>Well, AI is changing all that and cutting the frustration that comes with it! It is capable of tracking what bonuses you use and what games you play (and even when and how you play them), and that means that suddenly, casinos can offer much more tailored options when you’re playing on the slots. Free spins for your favourite game ever, just as you sit down to relax on a Friday night? Yes, that’s much more likely now!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Personalised bonus games? These are also creeping onto the scene, along with game features that are specifically honed to tick your “like” box and give you the best possible gaming experience. And it’s only because of AI that this is becoming possible &#8211; sure, casinos tried to offer this kind of personalisation in the past, but it was simply too much for humans to manage.</p>



<p>Of course, you must have been playing the slots for a while for this to work; the AI is dependent on having historical data of how you play and when you play to bring up these offers. The longer you’ve been playing and the more consistent your patterns are, the better the AI will be able to come up with offers that are perfect for you. As this system improves, maybe we’ll see slots that are completely unique for each individual &#8211; it could happen! And as AI becomes increasingly accepted and <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/2024/05/30/eu-launches-office-implement-ai-act-foster-innovation/">legislation is put into place</a> for it, we’re going to see more and more innovation in this space.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Learning about bluffing in poker</h4>



<p>How do you teach a computer to bluff? We’re not going to pretend it’s easy; it’s proven <a href="https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/poker-is-harder-for-ai-to-master-than-chess-ai-has-now-learned-to-bluff-and-beat-humans/">a major challenge</a> for those building AIs, getting a computer to mimic a human’s ability to deceive other players. However, we’re pretty much there, and AIs can now be incorporated into the online world of poker &#8211; one of the most popular casino games on the planet.</p>



<p>So, first off, they have created an AI that’s good at poker; there’s been major progress in advancing how the absolute best AI can play, and it’s doing well. However, that’s not actually enough for casinos: they don’t want an AI that can beat human players every time, because who would ever play against that? They need an AI that can understand nuance, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/intelligent-mistakes-how-to-incorporate-stupidity-into-your-ai-code#close-modal">make mistakes occasionally</a>, and lose &#8211; but in convincing ways that are still satisfying to play against. Now that’s a real challenge!</p>



<p>But if they’re successful, there’s going to be big rewards: some people would much rather play against a computer than other humans, provided the computer makes a satisfying opponent. This is likely to be an ongoing process as the AIs master how to play in each context, but it already looks promising to us! Of course, there are wary about teaching computers how to lie effectively… after all, sci-fi books and films have shown us exactly why that could be a bad idea. For the casino industry, though, it’s looking tantalising.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h4>



<p>AI isn’t “big” in most casino games yet, because it hasn’t had time to infiltrate them… but we’re likely to see it edging in from the fringes and changing more and more things about how we play and enjoy games online as the years come. It’s overly exciting to imagine how it might revolutionise classic games like poker, blackjack, roulette, the slots, and more. However, we’re just going to have to “wait and see” here, because AI is only just unfolding its metaphorical wings and starting to flap.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intelligent automation (IA) technologies are graduating from being operational to highly strategic. In terms of the bottom line, it’s even more impressive.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.blueprism.com/news/ssnc-forrester-tei-study/">A study from SS&amp;C Blue Prism</a>, conducted by Forrester Consulting and published in April, put together a composite organisation representative of five customers interviewed. The conclusion was that, over three years, there were key gains in IA from greater productivity to compliance cost avoidance, to improved employee experience and retention. This represented an overall net present value of $53.4 million (£42.5m) per customer.</p>



<p>Yet this may just be the tip of the iceberg. Dan Segura, enterprise sales manager at SS&amp;C Blue Prism, notes one healthcare client who, in what is described as a conservative estimate, delivered savings of more than $140m overall on cost avoidance and recoup. Another healthcare client delivered a use case with a claimed $43m benefit on its own; a bot which recouped overtime pay for nurses and staff during the pandemic.</p>



<p>“They built it in an afternoon,” Segura explains. “It’s a perfect example of being in the right place at the right time; and having the right skills and technology being ready.”</p>



<p>Many of the technologies which comprise intelligent automation have been around for a long time, such as classic RPA (robotic process automation) or OCR (optical character recognition). SS&amp;C Blue Prism’s document automation, which forms part of the latter, is described as a ‘game-changer’ by Segura. “There’s a lot of these processes, whether it’s going to be executed by a robot or a human,” he says. “First things first, we’ve got to get data off documents.</p>



<p>“Automation is not just doing simple tasks anymore thanks to the introduction of AI and generative AI” he adds. “There’s now more understanding, whether it’s assessing information from documents, information from a message, structuring things that are semi-structured or unstructured, to drive the process or complete the process.”</p>



<p>Segura describes wider business process management (BPM) and process orchestration tool Chorus, meanwhile, as ‘one of the world’s best kept secrets.’ Or, at least, it was; in November analyst Everest Group named the tool as a leader and star performer in its <a href="https://www.blueprism.com/news/process-orchestration-everest-peak/">Process Orchestration Products PEAK Matrix</a>.</p>



<p>The tool is now getting leverage outside the traditional finance and insurance fields. “It is how millions and millions of transactions and pieces of work are getting done every day,” says Segura. “We’re now seeing adoption [elsewhere] alongside automation to orchestrate their work and give them that end-to-end work orchestration, visibility, and efficiency gains with whatever they have going on.”</p>



<p>So how does a use case come to life? It is often a mixture of inspiration and perspiration. Where SS&amp;C Blue Prism comes in is to ‘help customers catch lightning’, as Segura puts it. “We’ve all been in that situation where it’s like ‘oh if I were running this place, here’s what I would do’,” he says. “Intelligent automation gives you the opportunity to reimagine your processes and transform how you get work done. Once that light switch turns on, and the initial use case is built, that’s really the secret sauce of SS&amp;C Blue Prism; it’s that realisation and awareness of what intelligent automation can deliver.</p>



<p>“We’re always learning from our customers,” adds Segura. “It’s at their direction because they know their business and processes better than anybody. Combine their business expertise with the transformational power of intelligent automation and its digital workforce, then that’s where the magic happens.”</p>



<p>Any organisation, argues Segura, regardless of the industry, has change agents and citizen builders in waiting. Don’t think that’s a misnomer; the term is definitely ‘builder’.</p>



<p>“I hear about these citizen developer programmes, and they’ll say, ‘here we have 500, 1000 citizen developers.’ What I don’t hear is, ‘and with this army of citizen developers we’ve achieved this’,” says Segura. “Whereas I have customers where two people have basically become citizen builders with more of a robust type of approach.” The $43m healthcare single use case is a case in point. “It is the whole mantra of SS&amp;C Blue Prism,” adds Segura. “We’re designed to go after those higher value chain automations that can have a tangible impact on some of the company’s key objectives.”</p>



<p>So, you have the idea, the value proposition, and the capability to build it out. How do you make it stick?&nbsp; Every organisation is different; though if your company has a continuous process improvement department then that can be a good place to start. Segura likens it to offshoring processes. “You don’t just wave it goodbye and never think about it again,” he explains. “At the end of the day, it still has to function.</p>



<p>“You’re not just ‘digital-shoring’ [automation] and it will essentially be taken care of by digital. Someone has to continuously improve the process; someone has to mind when something changes with the business rules or regulatory compliance; somebody has to be responsible for making sure that those changes are kept up in an agile way.”</p>



<p>SS&amp;C Blue Prism has a longstanding, large US retail customer that combines that lightning capture with the right internal culture around automation. This is a company that has 72,000 employees, as well as 60 ‘digital workers’ executing more than 150 automations. One such automation, through using OCR technology, lets the company automate the processing of inbound customer orders received by digital fax.</p>



<p>The overall result is 6.2 million transactions processed to date, and 250,000 hours of work returned to the business. But there is one extra ingredient required, particularly for a big company: discipline.</p>



<p>“It took them a while to get to that point in maturity,” explains Segura. “They do have a very central function when it comes to the intelligent automation team, [but] keep in mind one of those processes is in supply chain. That process is regularly reviewing 4.2 million purchase orders; it’s minding 50 million inventory case volume; it’s going through two million SKUs for 8000 suppliers.</p>



<p>“This is highly iterative, but it’s that process of having that lightning rod to capture the requirements and give people who are not necessarily technical a platform and a methodology to iterate very closely with the intelligent automation team,” adds Segura.</p>



<p>Think of what SS&amp;C Blue Prism does therefore as providing a superhero cape for those who don’t otherwise get the chance to step into the limelight. It is a message the company will look to broadcast at the <a href="https://intelligentautomation-conference.com/">Intelligent Automation</a> event in Santa Clara on 5-6 June.</p>



<p>“SS&amp;C Blue Prism opens up that door to enable your citizen builders really make an impact and deliver strategic benefits to the company,” says Segura. “You’re not just playing with a pilot, not just fooling around with something; you’re really getting into the strategic objectives of the company.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SAS, a specialist in data and AI solutions, has unveiled what it describes as a “game-changing approach” for organisations to tackle business challenges head-on.</p>



<p>Introducing lightweight, industry-specific AI models for individual licence, SAS hopes to equip organisations with readily deployable AI technology to productionise real-world use cases with unparalleled efficiency.</p>



<p>Chandana Gopal, research director, Future of Intelligence, IDC, said: “SAS is evolving its portfolio to meet wider user needs and capture market share with innovative new offerings,</p>



<p>“An area that is ripe for SAS is productising models built on SAS’ core assets, talent and IP from its wealth of experience working with customers to solve industry problems.”</p>



<p>In today’s market, the consumption of models is primarily focused on large language models (LLMs) for generative AI. In reality, LLMs are a very small part of the modelling needs of real-world production deployments of AI and decision making for businesses. With the new offering, SAS is moving beyond LLMs and delivering industry-proven deterministic AI models for industries that span use cases such as fraud detection, supply chain optimization, entity management, document conversation and health care payment integrity and more.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional AI implementations that can be cumbersome and time-consuming, SAS’ industry-specific models are engineered for quick integration, enabling organisations to operationalise trustworthy AI technology and accelerate the realisation of tangible benefits and trusted results.</p>



<p><strong>Expanding market footprint</strong></p>



<p>Organisations are facing pressure to compete effectively and are looking to AI to gain an edge. At the same time, staffing data science teams has never been more challenging due to AI skills shortages. Consequently, businesses are demanding agility in using AI to solve problems and require flexible AI solutions to quickly drive business outcomes. SAS’ easy-to-use, yet powerful models tuned for the enterprise enable organisations to benefit from a half-century of SAS’ leadership across industries.</p>



<p>Delivering industry models as packaged offerings is one outcome of SAS’ commitment of $1 billion to AIpowered industry solutions. As outlined in the May 2023 announcement, the investment in AI builds on SAS’ decades-long focus on providing packaged solutions to address industry challenges in banking, government, health care and more.</p>



<p>Udo Sglavo, VP for AI and Analytics, SAS, said: “Models are the perfect complement to our existing solutions and SAS Viya platform offerings and cater to diverse business needs across various audiences, ensuring that innovation reaches every corner of our ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“By tailoring our approach to understanding specific industry needs, our frameworks empower businesses to flourish in their distinctive Environments.”</p>



<p><strong>Bringing AI to the masses</strong></p>



<p>SAS is democratising AI by offering out-of-the-box, lightweight AI models – making AI accessible regardless of skill set – starting with an AI assistant for warehouse space optimisation. Leveraging technology like large language models, these assistants cater to nontechnical users, translating interactions into optimised workflows seamlessly and aiding in faster planning decisions.</p>



<p>Sgvalo said: “SAS Models provide organisations with flexible, timely and accessible AI that aligns with industry challenges.</p>



<p>“Whether you’re embarking on your AI journey or seeking to accelerate the expansion of AI across your enterprise, SAS offers unparalleled depth and breadth in addressing your business’s unique needs.”</p>



<p>The first SAS Models are expected to be generally available later this year.</p>

<p>The gambling industry, perpetually dynamic and adaptive to technological advancements, is experiencing a significant transformation with the integration of AI. The use of AI within this sector is reshaping the gambling landscape, bringing about profound changes in various facets of gambling operations and customer experiences. </p>



<p>Using AI in gambling experiences opens up new dimensions of interactivity and engagement. AI algorithms can optimise live dealer games, making them more responsive and adaptable to player preferences. </p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Enhanced personalisation and user experience</h5>



<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> has significantly altered the landscape of online gambling, offering a more personalised gaming experience. The technology analyses player behaviour, preferences, and playing patterns, tailoring game recommendations accordingly. </p>



<p>The adaptive approach allows AI to refine its suggestions continuously, ensuring each player&#8217;s experience is unique and aligned with their interests.</p>



<p>The algorithms employed in this process are sophisticated and capable of understanding nuanced player preferences. As players engage with various games, AI observes and learns, making adjustments to recommendations based on evolving playing styles or interests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, players get a more streamlined and enjoyable gaming experience, as they are presented with games that closely match their preferences.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Intelligence in marketing and profit management</h5>



<p>AI has revolutionised marketing strategies within the gambling industry. It enables operators to analyse the most popular games and identify underperforming machines. AI helps craft effective marketing campaigns and maximise profits by understanding player preferences. For example, targeted welcome offers and free spins attract new players and retain existing ones.</p>



<p>Furthermore, AI-driven casino analytics assist operators in identifying low-profit games, enabling them to make informed decisions about technological adjustments to improve revenues.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Rewards-based system intelligence</h5>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_casino">Online gambling</a> algorithms also play a crucial role in managing loyalty programs. AI enables operators to tailor VIP rewards based on player activity, enhancing customer retention. By analysing player behaviour, casinos can adjust reward levels and make VIP tiers more attainable or desirable, increasing player satisfaction and loyalty.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Security and fraud detection</h5>



<p>The use of AI in the online gambling sector marks a pivotal shift in how security is managed and maintained. AI, especially through machine learning algorithms, has emerged as a formidable tool in enhancing the security of these platforms, addressing a spectrum of challenges that were previously difficult to manage.</p>



<p>Machine learning algorithms, a core component of AI, excel in detecting anomalies in betting patterns, which is crucial in identifying and preventing fraudulent activities. These algorithms analyse vast amounts of data in real-time, learning from player behaviours to identify patterns that deviate from the norm.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Game development and innovation</h5>



<p>In game development, AI is enhancing existing games and also aiding in creating new ones. Developers use AI to generate dynamic content, adjust game difficulty in real-time based on player performance, and test new game mechanics. It results in more engaging and versatile games, offering a level of personalisation and dynamism previously unattainable​​.</p>



<p>The technological revolution is not just confined to digital gaming platforms but extends to <a href="https://www.cloudbet.com/en/casino/live">options for live play</a>, enhancing real-time gambling experiences in ways previously unimagined.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h5>



<p>The impact of AI on the gambling industry is both extensive and multifaceted. From enhancing user experiences through personalisation to bolstering security, AI&#8217;s role in this sector is undeniably transformative. However, it is crucial to navigate the ethical and practical challenges AI poses to ensure its integration benefits all stakeholders in the gambling industry. </p>

<p>At the core of DEPT®&#8217;s approach is the strategic utilisation of large language models. Briski articulated the delicate balance between the &#8216;pioneering&#8217; and &#8217;boutique&#8217; ethos encapsulated in their tagline, &#8220;pioneering work on a global scale with a boutique culture.&#8221;</p>



<p>While &#8216;pioneering&#8217; and &#8217;boutique&#8217; evokes innovation and personalised attention, &#8216;global scale&#8217; signifies the broad outreach. DEPT® harnesses large language models to disseminate highly targeted, personalised messages to expansive audiences. These models, Briski pointed out, enable DEPT® to comprehend individuals at a massive scale and foster meaningful and individualised interactions.</p>



<p>&#8220;The way that we have been using a lot of these large language models is really to deliver really small and targeted messages to a large audience,” says Briski.</p>



<p>However, the integration of AI into various domains – such as retail, sports, education, and healthcare – poses both opportunities and challenges. DEPT® navigates this complexity by leveraging generative AI and large language models trained on diverse datasets, including vast repositories like Wikipedia and the Library of Congress.</p>



<p>Briski emphasised the importance of marrying pre-trained data with DEPT®&#8217;s domain expertise to ensure precise contextual responses. This approach guarantees that clients receive accurate and relevant information tailored to their specific sectors.</p>



<p>&#8220;The pre-training of these models allows them to really expound upon a bunch of different domains,&#8221; explains Briski. &#8220;We can be pretty sure that the answer is correct and that we want to either send it back to the client or the consumer or some other system that is sitting in front of the consumer.&#8221;</p>



<p>One of DEPT®&#8217;s standout achievements lies in its foray into the web3 space and the metaverse. Briski shared the company&#8217;s collaboration with <a href="https://www.roblox.com/">Roblox</a>, a platform synonymous with interactive user experiences. DEPT®&#8217;s collaboration with Roblox revolves around empowering users to create and enjoy user-generated content at an unprecedented scale. </p>



<p>DEPT®&#8217;s internal project, <a href="https://preparetopioneer.com/">Prepare to Pioneer</a>, epitomises its commitment to innovation by nurturing embryonic ideas within its &#8216;Greenhouse&#8217;. DEPT® hones concepts to withstand the rigours of the external world, ensuring only the most robust ideas reach their clients.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have this internal project called The Greenhouse where we take these seeds of ideas and try to grow them into something that&#8217;s tough enough to handle the external world,” says Briski. &#8220;The ones that do survive are much more ready to use with our clients.&#8221;</p>



<p>While the allure of AI-driven solutions is undeniable, Briski underscored the need for caution. He warns that AI is not inherently transparent and trustworthy and emphasises the imperative of constructing robust foundations for quality assurance.</p>



<p>DEPT® employs automated testing to ensure responses align with expectations. Briski also stressed the importance of setting stringent parameters to guide AI conversations, ensuring alignment with the company&#8217;s ethos and desired consumer interactions.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to really keep focused on the exact conversation you want to have with your consumer or your customer and put really strict guardrails around how you would like the model to answer those questions,&#8221; explains Briski.</p>



<p>In December, DEPT® is sponsoring <a href="https://www.ai-expo.net/global/">AI &amp; Big Data Expo Global</a> and will be in attendance to share its unique insights. Briski is a speaker at the event and will be <a href="https://www.ai-expo.net/global/speaker/bob-briski/">providing</a> a deep dive into business intelligence (BI), illuminating strategies to enhance responsiveness through large language models.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;ll be diving into how we can transform BI to be much more responsive to the business, especially with the help of large language models,&#8221; says Briski.</p>



<p>As DEPT® continues to redefine digital paradigms, we look forward to observing how the company’s innovations deliver a new era in AI-powered experiences.</p>

<p>Data has long been the currency on which the enterprise operates – and it goes right to the very top. Analysts and thought leaders almost universally urge the importance of the <a href="https://morgansamuels.com/the-ceos-role-in-creating-a-data-driven-culture/">CEO being actively involved in data initiatives</a>. But what gets buried in the small print is the acknowledgement that many data projects never make it to production. In 2016, Gartner assessed it at <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2016-10-04-gartner-survey-reveals-investment-in-big-data-is-up-but-fewer-organizations-plan-to-invest">only 15%.</a></p>



<p>The operationalisation of data projects has been a key factor in helping organisations turn a data deluge into a workable digital transformation strategy, and DataOps carries on from where DevOps started. But there is a further Gartner warning: organisations who lack a sustainable data and analytics operationalisation framework by 2024 will <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/430318/1035298">see their initiatives set back by up to two years</a>.</p>



<p>Operationalisation needs good orchestration to make it work, as Basil Faruqui, director of solutions marketing at <a href="https://www.bmc.com/">BMC</a>, explains. “If you think about building a data pipeline, whether you’re doing a simple BI project or a complex AI or machine learning project, you’ve got data ingestion, data storage and processing, and data insight – and underneath all of those four stages, there’s a variety of different technologies being used,” explains Faruqui. “And everybody agrees that in production, this should be automated.”</p>



<p>This is where Control-M from BMC, and in particular BMC Helix Control-M comes in. Control-M has been an integral part of many organisations for upwards of three decades, enabling businesses to run hundreds of thousands of batch jobs daily and help optimise complex operations such as supply chain management. But an increasingly complex technological landscape, across on-premises to cloud, as well as a greater usage of SaaS-based orchestration alongside consumption, made it a <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/bmc-helix-control-m-the-journey-starts-today/">no-brainer to launch BMC Helix Control-M in 2020</a>.</p>



<p>“CRMs and ERPs had been going the <a href="https://event.eu.on24.com/wcc/r/8000090115/5161C87316B03D9378130F5C5F48E673?partnerref=TFwebsite">SaaS</a> route for a while, but we started seeing more demands from the operations world for SaaS consumption models,” explains Faruqui.</p>



<p>The upshot of being a mature company – BMC was founded in 1980 – is that many customers have simply extended Control-M into more modern use cases. One example of a large organisation – and long-standing BMC customer – running an extremely complex supply chain is food manufacturer Hershey’s.</p>



<p>Apart from the time-sensitive necessity of running a business with perishable, delicate goods, the company has significantly adopted Azure, moving some existing ETL applications to the cloud, while Hershey’s operations are built on a complex SAP environment. Amid this infrastructure Control-M, in the words of Hershey’s analyst Todd Lightner, ‘literally runs our business.’</p>



<p>Faruqui returns to the stages of data ingestion, storage, processing, and insight to explain how Hershey’s would tackle a significant holiday campaign, or decide where to ship product. “It’s all data driven,” Faruqui explains. “They’re ingesting data from lots of systems of record, that are ingesting data from outside of the company; they’re pulling all that into massive data lakes where they’re running AI and ML algorithms to figure out a lot of these outcomes, and feeding into the analytics layer where business executives can look at dashboards and reports to make important decisions.</p>



<p>“They’re a really good example of somebody who has used orchestration and automation with Control-M as a strategic option for them,” adds Faruqui.</p>



<p>Yet this leads into another important point. DataOps is an important part of BMC’s strategy, but it is not the only part. “Data pipelines are dependent on a layer of applications both above and below them,” says Faruqui. “If you think about Hershey’s, trying to figure out what kind of promotion they should run, a lot of that data may be coming from SAP. And SAP is not a static system; it’s a system that is constantly being updated with workflows.</p>



<p>“So how does the data pipeline know that SAP is actually done and the data is ready for the data pipeline to start? And when they figure out the strategy, all that information needs to go back to SAP because the ordering of raw materials and everything is not going to happen in the data pipeline, it’s going to happen in ERPs,” adds Faruqui.</p>



<p>“So Control-M is able to connect across this layer, which is different from many of the tools that exist in the DataOps space.”</p>



<p>Faruqui is speaking at the <a href="https://www.ai-expo.net/europe/track/day-2-paid-optimised-data-analytics/">AI &amp; Big Data Expo Europe</a> in Amsterdam in September around how orchestration and operationalisation is the next step in organisations’ DataOps journeys. So expect not only stories and best practices on what a successful journey looks like, and how to create data pipeline orchestration across hybrid environments combining multiple clouds with on-prem, but also a look at the future – and according to Faruqui, the complexity is only going one way.</p>



<p>“I think one of the things that will continue to be challenging is there’s just lots of different tools and capabilities that are coming up in the AI and ML space,” he explains. “If you look at AWS, Azure, Google, and you go to their website, and you click on their AI/ML offerings, it is quite extensive, and every event they do, they announce new capabilities and services. So that’s on the vendor side.</p>



<p>“On the customer side, what we’re seeing is they want to rapidly test and figure out which [tools] are going to be of use to them,” Faruqui adds. “So as an orchestration vendor, and orchestration in general within DataOps, this is both the challenge and the opportunity.</p>



<p>“The challenge is you’re going to have to keep up with this because orchestration doesn’t work if you can’t integrate into something new – but the opportunity here is that our customers are asking for this.</p>



<p>“They don’t want to have to reinvent the orchestration wheel every time they go and adopt new technology.”</p>
