<p>AI News caught up with Nerijus Šveistys, Senior Legal Counsel at <a href="https://oxylabs.io/">Oxylabs</a>, to understand the state of play when it comes to AI regulation and its potential implications for industries, businesses, and innovation.</p>



<p>“The boom of the last few years appears to have sparked a push to establish regulatory frameworks for AI governance,” explains Šveistys.</p>



<p>“This is a natural development, as the rise of AI seems to pose issues in data privacy and protection, bias and discrimination, safety, intellectual property, and other legal areas, as well as ethics that need to be addressed.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Regions diverge in regulatory strategy</h3>



<p>The European Union’s <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/eu-ai-act-early-prep-could-give-businesses-competitive-edge/">AI Act</a> has, unsurprisingly, positioned the region with a strict, centralised approach. The regulation, which came into force this year, is set to be fully effective by 2026.</p>



<p>Šveistys pointed out that the EU has acted relatively swiftly compared to other jurisdictions: “The main difference we can see is the comparative quickness with which the EU has released a uniform regulation to govern the use of all types of AI.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, other regions have opted for more piecemeal approaches. China, for instance, has been implementing regulations specific to certain AI technologies in a phased-out manner. According to Šveistys, China began regulating AI models as early as 2021.</p>



<p>“In 2021, they introduced regulation on recommendation algorithms, which [had] increased their capabilities in digital advertising. It was followed by regulations <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/chinas-deepfake-laws-come-into-effect-today/">on deep synthesis models</a> or, in common terms, deepfakes and content generation in 2022,” he said.</p>



<p>“Then, in 2023, regulation on generative AI models was introduced as these models were making a splash in commercial usage.”</p>



<p>The US, in contrast, remains relatively uncoordinated in its approach. Federal-level regulations are yet to be enacted, with efforts mostly emerging at the state level.</p>



<p>“There are proposed regulations at the state level, such as the so-called California AI Act, but even if they come into power, it may still take some time before they do,” Šveistys noted.</p>



<p>This delay in implementing unified AI regulations in the US has raised questions about the extent to which business pushback may be contributing to the slow rollout. Šveistys said that while lobbyist pressure is a known factor, it’s not the only potential reason.</p>



<p>“There was <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/tech-industry-giants-urge-eu-streamline-ai-regulations/">pushback to the EU AI Act</a>, too, which was nevertheless introduced. Thus, it is not clear whether the delay in the US is only due to lobbyism or other obstacles in the legislation enactment process,” explains Šveistys.</p>



<p>“It might also be because some still see AI as a futuristic concern, not fully appreciating the extent to which it is already a legal issue of today.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Balancing innovation and safety</h3>



<p>Differentiated regulatory approaches could affect the pace of innovation and business competitiveness across regions.</p>



<p>Europe’s regulatory framework, though more stringent, aims to ensure consumer protection and ethical adherence—something that less-regulated environments may lack.</p>



<p>“More rigid regulatory frameworks may impose compliance costs for businesses in the AI field and stifle competitiveness and innovation. On the other hand, they bring the benefits of protecting consumers and adhering to certain ethical norms,” comments Šveistys.</p>



<p>This trade-off is especially pronounced in AI-related sectors such as targeted advertising, where algorithmic bias is increasingly scrutinised.</p>



<p>AI governance often extends beyond laws that specifically target AI, incorporating related legal areas like those governing data collection and privacy. For example, the EU AI Act also regulates the use of AI in physical devices, such as elevators.</p>



<p>&#8220;Additionally, all businesses that collect data for advertisement are potentially affected as AI regulation can also cover algorithmic bias in targeted advertising,&#8221; emphasises Šveistys.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Impact on related industries</h3>



<p>One industry that is deeply intertwined with AI developments is web scraping. Typically used for collecting publicly available data, web scraping is undergoing an AI-driven evolution.</p>



<p>&#8220;From data collection, validation, analysis, or overcoming anti-scraping measures, there is a lot of potential for AI to massively improve the efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability of web scraping operations,&#8221; said Šveistys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as AI regulation and related laws tighten, web scraping companies will face greater scrutiny.</p>



<p>“AI regulations may also bring the spotlight on certain areas of law that were always very relevant to the web scraping industry, such as privacy or copyright laws,” Šveistys added.</p>



<p>“At the end of the day, scraping content protected by such laws without proper authorisation could always lead to legal issues, and now so can using AI this way.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Copyright battles and legal precedents</h3>



<p>The implications of AI regulation are also playing out on a broader legal stage, particularly in cases involving generative AI tools.</p>



<p>High-profile <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/openai-and-microsoft-lawsuit-github-copilot/">lawsuits</a> have been launched against AI giants like OpenAI and its primary backer, Microsoft, by authors, artists, and musicians who claim their copyrighted materials were used to train AI systems without proper permission.</p>



<p>“These cases are pivotal in determining the legal boundaries of using copyrighted material for AI development and establishing legal precedents for protecting intellectual property in the digital age,” said Šveistys.</p>



<p>While these lawsuits could take years to resolve, their outcomes may fundamentally shape the future of AI development. So, what can businesses do now as the regulatory and legal landscape continues to evolve?</p>



<p>“Speaking about the specific cases of using copyrighted material for AI training, businesses should approach this the same way as any web-scraping activity – that is, evaluate the specific data they wish to collect with the help of a legal expert in the field,” recommends Šveistys.</p>



<p>“It is important to recognise that the AI legal landscape is very new and rapidly evolving, with not many precedents in place to refer to as of yet. Hence, continuous monitoring and adaptation of your AI usage are crucial.”</p>



<p>Just this week, the UK Government made headlines with its announcement of a consultation on the use of copyrighted material for training AI models. Under the proposals, tech firms could be permitted to use copyrighted material unless owners have specifically opted out.</p>



<p>Despite the diversity of approaches globally, the AI regulatory push marks a significant moment for technological governance. Whether through the EU’s comprehensive model, China’s step-by-step strategy, or narrower, state-level initiatives like in the US, businesses worldwide must navigate a complex, evolving framework.</p>



<p>The challenge ahead will be striking the right balance between fostering innovation and mitigating risks, ensuring that AI remains a force for good while avoiding potential harms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The UK Government wants to prove that AI is being deployed responsibly within public services to speed up decision-making, reduce backlogs, and enhance support for citizens.</p>



<p>New records, part of the Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard (ATRS), were <a href="https://www.gov.uk/algorithmic-transparency-records">published</a> this week to shed light on the AI tools being used and set a benchmark for transparency and accountability in the integration of technology in public service delivery.</p>



<p>The initiative is part of the government’s broader strategy to embrace technology to improve outcomes, echoing commitments outlined in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/missions">&#8220;Plan for Change&#8221;</a> to modernise public services and drive economic growth through innovative solutions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The power of AI for modernisation</h3>



<p>Among the published records, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office is leveraging AI to provide faster responses to Britons seeking assistance overseas. Similarly, the Ministry of Justice is utilising algorithms to help researchers gain a deeper understanding of how individuals interact with the justice system, while other departments are deploying AI to enhance job advertisements.</p>



<p>The ATRS aims to document how such algorithmic tools are utilised and ensure their responsible application. By doing so, the government hopes to strengthen public trust in these innovations while encouraging their continued adoption across sectors.</p>



<p>Speaking on the government’s approach, Science Secretary Peter Kyle remarked:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;Technology has huge potential to transform public services for the better; we will put it to use to cut backlogs, save money, and improve outcomes for citizens across the country.</em></p>



<p><em>Transparency in how and why the public sector is using algorithmic tools is crucial to ensure that they are trusted and effective. That is why we will continue to take bold steps like releasing these records to make sure everyone is clear on how we are applying and trialling technology as we use it to bring public services back from the brink.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Specifically, the Department for Business and Trade has highlighted its algorithmic tool designed to predict which companies are likely to export goods internationally.</p>



<p>The AI-driven approach allows officials to target support towards high-growth potential businesses, enabling them to reach global markets faster. Previously reliant on time-consuming manual methods to analyse the more than five million companies registered on Companies House, this advancement ensures better allocation of resources and expedited assistance.</p>



<p>Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;Our Plan for Change will deliver economic growth, and for that to succeed, we need to support companies across the UK to realise their full potential when it comes to exporting around the globe.</em></p>



<p><em>Our use of AI plays a vital and growing role in that mission, allowing high-growth businesses to maximise the export opportunities available to them, while ensuring that we are using taxpayers’ money responsibly and efficiently in delivering economic stability.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing clear guidelines for AI in public services</h3>



<p>To bolster public trust, new guidelines have been announced to clarify the scope of algorithmic transparency records.</p>



<p>Central government organisations will need to publish a record for any algorithmic tool that interacts directly with citizens or plays a significant role in decision-making about individuals. Limited exceptions, such as those concerning national security, apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These records will be published once tools are piloted publicly or have become operational. They will detail the data used to train AI models, the underlying technologies, and the measures implemented to mitigate risks.</p>



<p>Importantly, the records also seek to confirm that – while AI tools are used to accelerate decision-making processes – human oversight remains integral, with trained staff responsible for final decisions.</p>



<p>Dr Antonio Espingardeiro, a member of <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a> and an expert in software and robotics, commented:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;AI has the potential to radically transform the public sector. In recent years, we have seen AI become a credible part of everyday public services. As it becomes more sophisticated, AI can conduct data-heavy tasks traditionally undertaken by humans. It can analyse vast quantities of information and, when coupled with machine learning, search through records and infer patterns or anomalies in data that would otherwise take decades for humans to analyse.</em></p>



<p><em>With this announcement, the UK government has acknowledged AI’s potential and proven that technology investment is essential to improving outcomes and the delivery of vital services. Over time, machine learning and generative AI (GenAI) could bring substantial value to the public system. With increased adoption, we will soon be able to deliver the scalability that the public sector needs and relieve the pressures and workloads placed on staff.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eleanor Watson, also a member of IEEE and an AI ethics engineer affiliated with <a href="https://www.su.org/">Singularity University</a>, added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;With AI growing more rapidly than ever before, and already being tested and employed in education, healthcare, transportation, finance, data security, and more, the government, tech leaders, and academia should work together to establish standards and regulations for safe and responsible development of AI-based systems. This way, AI can be used to its full potential as indicated with this latest announcement.</em></p>



<p><em>Data privacy is probably the most critical ethical consideration, requiring informed consent, data anonymisation, strict access controls, secure storage, and compliance. New techniques such as homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, federated learning, and part-trained models can help models to make use of our personal data in an encrypted form.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Transparency remains a key tenet of the UK Government’s AI strategy. This announcement follows a recent statement by Pat McFadden, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who affirmed that the benefits of technology – particularly AI – must span both public and private sectors and be used to modernise government.</p>



<p>As the Science Secretary’s department solidifies government efforts to create a &#8220;digital centre,&#8221; it marks a major step forward in boosting the responsible and effective use of AI across the UK’s public sector.</p>



<p>The ATRS records offer a valuable template for how governments worldwide can deploy AI systems to maximise efficiency, grow transparency, and balance the need for innovation with ethical considerations.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence platform provider Clarifai has unveiled a new compute orchestration capability that promises to help enterprises optimise their AI workloads in any computing environment, reduce costs and avoid vendor lock-in.</p>



<p>Announced on December 3, 2024, the <a href="https://docs.clarifai.com/sdk/compute-orchestration/">public preview release</a> lets organisations orchestrate AI workloads through a unified control plane, whether those workloads are running on cloud, on-premises, or in air-gapped infrastructure. The platform can work with any AI model and hardware accelerator including GPUs, CPUs, and TPUs.</p>



<p>&#8220;Clarifai has always been ahead of the curve, with over a decade of experience supporting large enterprise and mission-critical government needs with the full stack of AI tools to create custom AI workloads,&#8221; <a href="https://www.clarifai.com/press-release/clarifai-launches-first-vendor-agnostic-compute-orchestration-capabilities-to-optimize-ai-performance-and-spend">said</a> Matt Zeiler, founder and CEO of Clarifai. &#8220;Now, we&#8217;re opening up capabilities we built internally to optimise our compute costs as we scale to serve millions of models simultaneously.&#8221;</p>



<p>The company claims its platform can reduce compute usage by 3.7x through model packing optimisations while supporting over 1.6 million inference requests per second with 99.9997% reliability. According to Clarifai, the optimisations can potentially cut costs by 60-90%, depending on configuration.</p>



<p>Capabilities of the compute orchestration platform include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cost optimisation through automated resource management, including model packing, dependency simplification, and customisable auto-scaling options that can scale to zero for model replicas and compute nodes,</li>



<li>Deployment flexibility on <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/clarifai-launches-mobile-sdk-help-make-ai-available-devices/">any hardware</a> vendor including cloud, on-premise, air-gapped, and Clarifai SaaS infrastructure,</li>



<li>Integration with Clarifai&#8217;s AI platform for data labeling, training, evaluation, workflows, and feedback,</li>



<li>Security features that allow deployment into customer VPCs or on-premise Kubernetes clusters without requiring open inbound ports, VPC peering, or custom IAM roles.</li>
</ul>



<p>The platform emerged from Clarifai customers&#8217; issues with AI performance and cost. &#8220;If we had a way to think about it holistically and look at our on-prem costs compared to our cloud costs, and then be able to orchestrate across environments with a cost basis, that would be incredibly valuable,&#8221; noted a customer, as cited in Clarifai&#8217;s announcement.</p>



<p>The compute orchestration capabilities build on Clarifai&#8217;s existing AI platform that, the company says, has processed over 2 billion operations in computer vision, language, and audio AI. The company reports maintaining 99.99%+ uptime and 24/7 availability for critical applications.</p>



<p>The compute orchestration capability is currently available in public preview. Organisations interested in testing the platform should contact Clarifai for access.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai has announced the launch of Gemini 2.0, a model that represents the next step in Google’s ambition to revolutionise AI.</p>



<p>A year after introducing the Gemini 1.0 model, this major upgrade incorporates enhanced multimodal capabilities, agentic functionality, and innovative user tools designed to push boundaries in AI-driven technology.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Leap towards transformational AI&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Reflecting on Google’s 26-year mission to organise and make the world’s information accessible, Pichai remarked, “If Gemini 1.0 was about organising and understanding information, Gemini 2.0 is about making it much more useful.”</p>



<p>Gemini 1.0, released in December 2022, was notable for being Google’s first natively multimodal AI model. The first iteration excelled at understanding and processing text, video, images, audio, and code. Its enhanced 1.5 version became widely embraced by developers for its long-context understanding, enabling applications such as the productivity-focused NotebookLM.</p>



<p>Now, with Gemini 2.0, Google aims to accelerate the role of AI as a universal assistant capable of native image and audio generation, better reasoning and planning, and real-world decision-making capabilities. In Pichai&#8217;s words, the development represents the dawn of an “agentic era.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Introducing Gemini 2.0 | Our most capable AI model yet" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fs0t6SdODd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>“We have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision,” Pichai explained.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gemini 2.0: Core features and availability</h3>



<p>At the heart of today&#8217;s announcement is the experimental release of Gemini 2.0 Flash, the flagship model of Gemini’s second generation. It builds upon the foundations laid by its predecessors while delivering faster response times and advanced performance.</p>



<p>Gemini 2.0 Flash supports multimodal inputs and outputs, including the ability to generate native images in conjunction with text and produce steerable text-to-speech multilingual audio. Additionally, users can benefit from native tool integration such as Google Search and even third-party user-defined functions.</p>



<p>Developers and businesses will gain access to Gemini 2.0 Flash via the Gemini API in <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/">Google AI Studio</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai">Vertex AI</a>, while larger model sizes are scheduled for broader release in January 2024.</p>



<p>For global accessibility, the Gemini app now features a chat-optimised version of the 2.0 Flash experimental model. Early adopters can experience this updated assistant on desktop and mobile, with a mobile app rollout imminent.</p>



<p>Products such as Google Search are also being enhanced with Gemini 2.0, unlocking the ability to handle complex queries like advanced math problems, coding enquiries, and multimodal questions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Comprehensive suite of AI innovations&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The launch of Gemini 2.0 comes with compelling new tools that showcase its capabilities.</p>



<p>One such feature, Deep Research, functions as an AI research assistant, simplifying the process of investigating complex topics by compiling information into comprehensive reports. Another upgrade enhances Search with Gemini-enabled AI Overviews that tackle intricate, multi-step user queries.</p>



<p>The model was trained using Google’s sixth-generation Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), known as Trillium, which Pichai notes “powered 100% of Gemini 2.0 training and inference.”</p>



<p>Trillium is now <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/trillium-tpu-is-ga">available</a> for external developers, allowing them to benefit from the same infrastructure that supports Google’s own advancements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pioneering agentic experiences&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Accompanying Gemini 2.0 are experimental “agentic” prototypes built to explore the future of human-AI collaboration, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Project Astra: A universal AI assistant</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>First introduced at I/O earlier this year, Project Astra taps into Gemini 2.0’s multimodal understanding to improve real-world AI interactions. Trusted testers have trialled the assistant on Android, offering feedback that has helped refine its multilingual dialogue, memory retention, and integration with Google tools like Search, Lens, and Maps. Astra has also demonstrated near-human conversational latency, with further research underway for its application in wearable technology, such as prototype AI glasses.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Project Mariner: Redefining web automation </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Project Mariner is an experimental web-browsing assistant that uses Gemini 2.0’s ability to reason across text, images, and interactive elements like forms within a browser. In initial tests, it achieved an 83.5% success rate on the WebVoyager benchmark for completing end-to-end web tasks. Early testers using a Chrome extension are helping to refine Mariner’s capabilities while Google evaluates safety measures that ensure the technology remains user-friendly and secure.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Jules: A coding agent for developers  </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Jules, an AI-powered assistant built for developers, integrates directly into GitHub workflows to address coding challenges. It can autonomously propose solutions, generate plans, and execute code-based tasks—all under human supervision. This experimental endeavour is part of Google’s long-term goal to create versatile AI agents across various domains.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Gaming applications and beyond  </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Extending Gemini 2.0’s reach into virtual environments, Google DeepMind is working with gaming partners like Supercell on intelligent game agents. These experimental AI companions can interpret game actions in real-time, suggest strategies, and even access broader knowledge via Search. Research is also being conducted into how Gemini 2.0’s spatial reasoning could support robotics, opening doors for physical-world applications in the future.</p>

</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Addressing responsibility in AI development</h3>



<p>As AI capabilities expand, Google emphasises the importance of prioritising safety and ethical considerations.</p>



<p>Google claims Gemini 2.0 underwent extensive risk assessments, bolstered by the Responsibility and Safety Committee’s oversight to mitigate potential risks. Additionally, its embedded reasoning abilities allow for <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/openai-enhances-ai-safety-new-red-teaming-methods/">advanced “red-teaming,”</a> enabling developers to evaluate security scenarios and optimise safety measures at scale.</p>



<p>Google is also exploring safeguards to address user privacy, prevent misuse, and ensure AI agents remain reliable. For instance, Project Mariner is designed to prioritise user instructions while resisting malicious prompt injections, preventing threats like phishing or fraudulent transactions. Meanwhile, privacy controls in Project Astra make it easy for users to manage session data and deletion preferences.</p>



<p>Pichai reaffirmed the company’s commitment to responsible development, stating, “We firmly believe that the only way to build AI is to be responsible from the start.”</p>



<p>With the Gemini 2.0 Flash release, Google is edging closer to its vision of building a universal assistant capable of transforming interactions across domains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Researchers from the <a href="https://www.tus.ac.jp/en/">Tokyo University of Science</a> (TUS) have developed a method to enable large-scale AI models to selectively &#8220;forget&#8221; specific classes of data.</p>



<p>Progress in AI has provided tools capable of revolutionising various domains, from healthcare to autonomous driving. However, as technology advances, so do its complexities and ethical considerations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paradigm of large-scale pre-trained AI systems, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and <a href="https://openai.com/index/clip/">CLIP</a> (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training), has reshaped expectations for machines. These highly generalist models, capable of handling a vast array of tasks with consistent precision, have seen widespread adoption for both professional and personal use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, such versatility comes at a hefty price. Training and running these models demands prodigious amounts of energy and time, raising sustainability concerns, as well as requiring cutting-edge hardware significantly more expensive than standard computers. Compounding these issues is that generalist tendencies may hinder the efficiency of AI models when applied to specific tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, “in practical applications, the classification of all kinds of object classes is rarely required,” explains Associate Professor Go Irie, who led the research. “For example, in an autonomous driving system, it would be sufficient to recognise limited classes of objects such as cars, pedestrians, and traffic signs.</p>



<p>“We would not need to recognise food, furniture, or animal species. Retaining classes that do not need to be recognised may decrease overall classification accuracy, as well as cause operational disadvantages such as the waste of computational resources and the risk of information leakage.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A potential solution lies in training models to “forget” redundant or unnecessary information—streamlining their processes to focus solely on what is required. While some existing methods already cater to this need, they tend to assume a “white-box” approach where users have access to a model’s internal architecture and parameters. Oftentimes, however, users get no such visibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Black-box” AI systems, more common due to commercial and ethical restrictions, conceal their inner mechanisms, rendering traditional forgetting techniques impractical. To address this gap, the research team turned to derivative-free optimisation—an approach that sidesteps reliance on the inaccessible internal workings of a model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Advancing through forgetting</h3>



<p>The study, set to be presented at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference in 2024, introduces a methodology dubbed “black-box forgetting.”</p>



<p>The process modifies the input prompts (text instructions fed to models) in iterative rounds to make the AI progressively &#8220;forget&#8221; certain classes. Associate Professor Irie collaborated on the work with co-authors Yusuke Kuwana and Yuta Goto (both from TUS), alongside Dr Takashi Shibata from <a href="https://www.nec.com/">NEC Corporation</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For their experiments, the researchers targeted CLIP, a vision-language model with image classification abilities. The method they developed is built upon the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), an evolutionary algorithm designed to optimise solutions step-by-step. In this study, CMA-ES was harnessed to evaluate and hone prompts provided to CLIP, ultimately suppressing its ability to classify specific image categories.</p>



<p>As the project progressed, challenges arose. Existing optimisation techniques struggled to scale up for larger volumes of targeted categories, leading the team to devise a novel parametrisation strategy known as &#8220;latent context sharing.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This approach breaks latent context – a representation of information generated by prompts – into smaller, more manageable pieces. By allocating certain elements to a single token (word or character) while reusing others across multiple tokens, they dramatically reduced the problem&#8217;s complexity. Crucially, this made the process computationally tractable even for extensive forgetting applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through benchmark tests on multiple image classification datasets, the researchers validated the efficacy of black-box forgetting—achieving the goal of making CLIP &#8220;forget&#8221; approximately 40% of target classes without direct access to the AI model&#8217;s internal architecture.</p>



<p>This research marks the first successful attempt to induce selective forgetting in a black-box vision-language model, demonstrating promising results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of helping AI models forget data</h3>



<p>Beyond its technical ingenuity, this innovation holds significant potential for real-world applications where task-specific precision is paramount.</p>



<p>Simplifying models for specialised tasks could make them faster, more resource-efficient, and capable of running on less powerful devices—hastening the adoption of AI in areas previously deemed unfeasible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another key use lies in image generation, where forgetting entire categories of visual context could prevent models from inadvertently creating undesirable or harmful content, be it offensive material or misinformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps most importantly, this method addresses one of AI’s greatest ethical quandaries: <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/categories/privacy/">privacy</a>.</p>



<p>AI models, particularly large-scale ones, are often trained on massive datasets that may inadvertently contain sensitive or outdated information. Requests to remove such data—especially in light of laws advocating for the “Right to be Forgotten”—pose significant challenges.</p>



<p>Retraining entire models to exclude problematic data is costly and time-intensive, yet the risks of leaving it unaddressed can have far-reaching consequences.</p>



<p>“Retraining a large-scale model consumes enormous amounts of energy,” notes Associate Professor Irie. “‘Selective forgetting,’ or so-called machine unlearning, may provide an efficient solution to this problem.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These privacy-focused applications are especially relevant in high-stakes industries like <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/categories/ai-industries/healthcare/">healthcare</a> and <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/large-language-models-could-revolutionsise-the-finance-sector-within-two-years/">finance</a>, where sensitive data is central to operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the global race to advance AI accelerates, the Tokyo University of Science’s black-box forgetting approach charts an important path forward—not only by making the technology more adaptable and efficient but also by adding significant safeguards for users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the potential for misuse remains, methods like selective forgetting demonstrate that researchers are proactively addressing both ethical and practical challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>OpenAI and other leading AI companies are developing new training techniques to overcome limitations of current methods. Addressing unexpected delays and complications in the development of larger, more powerful language models, these fresh techniques focus on human-like behaviour to teach algorithms to &#8216;think.</p>



<p>Reportedly led by a dozen AI researchers, scientists, and investors, the new training techniques, which underpin OpenAI&#8217;s recent <a href="https://openai.com/o1/">&#8216;o1&#8217; model</a> (formerly Q* and Strawberry), have the potential to transform the landscape of AI development. The reported advances may influence the types or quantities of resources AI companies need continuously, including specialised hardware and energy to aid the development of AI models.</p>



<p>The o1 model is designed to approach problems in a way that mimics human reasoning and thinking, breaking down numerous tasks into steps. The model also utilises specialised data and feedback provided by experts in the AI industry to enhance its performance.</p>



<p>Since ChatGPT was unveiled by OpenAI in 2022, there has been a surge in AI innovation, and many technology companies claim existing AI models require expansion, be it through greater quantities of data or improved computing resources. Only then can AI models consistently improve.</p>



<p>Now, AI experts have reported limitations in scaling up AI models. The 2010s were a revolutionary period for scaling, but Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, says that the training of AI models, particularly in the understanding language structures and patterns, has levelled off.</p>



<p>&#8220;The 2010s were the age of scaling, now we&#8217;re back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Scaling the right thing matters more now,&#8221; they said.</p>



<p>In recent times, AI lab researchers have experienced delays in and challenges to developing and releasing large language models (LLM) that are more powerful than OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-4 model.</p>



<p>First, there is the cost of training large models, often running into tens of millions of dollars. And, due to complications that arise, like hardware failing due to system complexity, a final analysis of how these models run can take months.</p>



<p>In addition to these challenges, training runs require substantial amounts of energy, often resulting in power shortages that can disrupt processes and impact the wider electriciy grid. Another issue is the colossal amount of data large language models use, so much so that AI models have reportedly used up all accessible data worldwide.</p>



<p>Researchers are exploring a technique known as &#8216;test-time compute&#8217; to improve current AI models when being trained or during inference phases. The method can involve the generation of multiple answers in real-time to decide on a range of best solutions. Therefore, the model can allocate greater processing resources to difficult tasks that require human-like decision-making and reasoning. The aim &#8211; to make the model more accurate and capable.</p>



<p>Noam Brown, a researcher at OpenAI who helped develop the o1 model, shared an example of how a new approach can achieve surprising results. At the TED AI conference in San Francisco last month, Brown explained that &#8220;having a bot think for just 20 seconds in a hand of poker got the same boosting performance as scaling up the model by 100,000x and training it for 100,000 times longer.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rather than simply increasing the model size and training time, this can change how AI models process information and lead to more powerful, efficient systems.</p>



<p>It is reported that other AI labs have been developing versions of the o1 technique. The include <a href="https://x.ai/">xAI</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.google/">Google DeepMind</a>, and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>. Competition in the AI world is nothing new, but we could see a significant impact on the AI hardware market as a result of new techniques. Companies like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/">Nvidia</a>, which currently dominates the supply of AI chips due to the high demand for their products, may be particularly affected by updated AI training techniques.</p>



<p>Nvidia became the world&#8217;s most valuable company in October, and its rise in fortunes can be largely attributed to its chips&#8217; use in AI arrays. New techniques may impact Nvidia&#8217;s market position, forcing the company to adapt its products to meet the evolving AI hardware demand. Potentially, this could open more avenues for new competitors in the inference market.</p>



<p>A new age of AI development may be on the horizon, driven by evolving hardware demands and more efficient training methods such as those deployed in the o1 model. The future of both AI models and the companies behind them could be reshaped, unlocking unprecedented possibilities and greater competition.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.superintelligence.io/">ASI Alliance</a> has introduced AIRIS (Autonomous Intelligent Reinforcement Inferred Symbolism) that “learns” within the popular game, <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a>.</p>



<p>AIRIS represents the first proto-AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) to harness a comprehensive tech stack across the alliance.</p>



<p>SingularityNET, founded by renowned AI researcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Goertzel">Dr Ben Goertzel</a>, uses agent technology from Fetch.ai, incorporates Ocean Data for long-term memory capabilities, and is soon expected to integrate CUDOS Compute infrastructure for scalable processing power.</p>



<p>“AIRIS is a significant step in the direction of practical, scalable neural-symbolic learning, and – alongside its already powerful and valuable functionality – it illustrates several general points about neural-symbolic systems, such as their ability to learn precise generalisable conclusions from small amounts of data,” explains Goertzel.</p>



<p>According to the company, this alliance-driven procedure propels AIRIS towards AGI—crafting one of the first intelligent systems with autonomous and adaptive learning that holds practical applications for real-world scenarios.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AIRIS&#8217; learning mechanisms</h3>



<p>AIRIS is crafted to enhance its understanding by interacting directly with its environment, venturing beyond the traditional AI limitations that depend on predefined rules or vast datasets. Instead, AIRIS evolves through observation, experimentation, and continual refinement of its unique “rule set.”</p>



<p>This system facilitates a profound level of problem-solving and contextual comprehension, with its implementation in Minecraft setting a new benchmark for AI interaction with both digital and tangible landscapes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="qme" dir="ltr">👀 <a href="https://t.co/jTeQFulzFJ">pic.twitter.com/jTeQFulzFJ</a></p>&mdash; Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (@ASI_Alliance) <a href="https://twitter.com/ASI_Alliance/status/1853874156527370650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Shifting from a controlled 2D grid to the sophisticated 3D world of Minecraft, AIRIS faced numerous challenges—including terrain navigation and adaptive problem-solving in a dynamic environment. This transition underscores AIRIS&#8217; autonomy in navigation, exploration, and learning.</p>



<p>The AIRIS Minecraft Agent distinguishes itself from other AI entities through several key features:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Dynamic navigation:</strong> AIRIS initially evaluates its milieu to formulate movement strategies, adapting to new environments in real-time. Its capabilities include manoeuvring around obstacles, jumping over barriers, and anticipating reactions to varied terrains.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Obstacle adaptation:</strong> It learns to navigate around impediments like cliffs and forested areas, refining its rule set with every new challenge to avoid redundant errors and minimise needless trial-and-error efforts.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Efficient pathfinding:</strong> Via continuous optimisation, AIRIS advances from initially complex navigation paths to streamlined, direct routes as it &#8220;comprehends&#8221; Minecraft dynamics.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Real-time environmental adaptation:</strong> Contrasting with conventional reinforcement learning systems that demand extensive retraining for new environments, AIRIS adapts immediately to unfamiliar regions, crafting new rules based on partial observations dynamically.</li>
</ul>



<p>AIRIS&#8217; adeptness in dealing with fluctuating terrains, including water bodies and cave systems, introduces sophisticated rule refinement founded on hands-on experience. Additionally, AIRIS boasts optimised computational efficiency—enabling real-time management of complex rules without performance compromises.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Future applications</h3>



<p>Minecraft serves as an excellent launchpad for AIRIS&#8217; prospective applications, establishing a solid foundation for expansive implementations:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Enhanced object interaction:</strong> Forthcoming stages will empower AIRIS to engage more profoundly with its surroundings, improving capabilities in object manipulation, construction, and even crafting. This development will necessitate AIRIS to develop a more refined decision-making framework for contextual tasks.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Social AI collaboration:</strong> Plans are underway to incorporate AIRIS in multi-agent scenarios, where agents learn, interact, and fulfil shared objectives, simulating real-world social dynamics and problem-solving collaboratively.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Abstract and strategic reasoning:</strong> Expanded developments will enhance AIRIS’s reasoning, enabling it to tackle complex goals such as resource management and prioritisation, moving beyond basic navigation towards strategic gameplay.</li>
</ul>



<p>The transition of AIRIS to 3D environments signifies a pivotal advancement in the ASI Alliance’s mission to cultivate AGI. Through AIRIS’s achievements in navigating and learning within Minecraft, the ASI Alliance aspires to expedite its deployment in the real world, pioneering applications for autonomous robots, intelligent home assistants, and other systems requiring adaptive learning and problem-solving capacities.</p>



<p>Berick Cook, AI Developer at SingularityNET and creator of AIRIS, said: “AIRIS is a whole new way of approaching the problem of machine learning. We are only just beginning to explore its capabilities. We are excited to see how we can apply it to problems that have posed a significant challenge for traditional reinforcement learning.</p>



<p>“The most important aspect of AIRIS to me is its transparency and explainability. Moving away from ‘Black Box’ AI represents a significant leap forward in the pursuit of safe, ethical, and beneficial AI.”</p>



<p>The innovative approach to AI evident in AIRIS – emphasising self-directed learning and continuous rule refinement – lays the foundation for AI systems capable of independent functioning in unpredictable real-world environments. Minecraft’s intricate ecosystem enables the system to hone its skills within a controlled yet expansive virtual setting, effectively bridging the divide between simulation and reality.</p>



<p>The AIRIS Minecraft Agent represents the inaugural tangible step towards an AI that learns from, adapts to and makes autonomous decisions about its environment. This accomplishment illustrates the potential of such technology to re-envision AI&#8217;s role across various industries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> (OSI) has unveiled a definition framework to evaluate whether AI systems can be classified as open-source.</p>



<p>The announcement of the first Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) was made at <a href="https://allthingsopen.org/">All Things Open</a> and marks the culmination of a comprehensive global effort spanning multiple years of research, international workshops, and a year-long community design process.</p>



<p>The OSI – widely recognised as the definitive authority on open-source definitions by individuals, organisations, and government bodies worldwide – developed the framework through extensive collaboration with industry stakeholders. This framework defines what open-source AI means, insisting that the same open-source requirements apply whether to a fully functional AI system, a model, weights and parameters, or other structural elements.</p>



<p>An open-source AI system must be made available under terms that grant four essential freedoms:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Use the system for any purpose</strong> and without having to ask for permission.</li>



<li><strong>Study how the system works</strong> and inspect its components.</li>



<li><strong>Modify the system</strong> for any purpose, including to change its output.</li>



<li><strong>Share the system</strong> for others to use with or without modifications, for any purpose.</li>
</ul>



<p>These freedoms apply both to a fully functional system and to discrete elements of a system. A precondition to exercising these freedoms is having access to the preferred form to make modifications to the system, which includes detailed data information, complete source code, and model parameters.</p>



<p>&#8220;The co-design process that led to version 1.0 of the Open Source AI Definition was well-developed, thorough, inclusive, and fair,&#8221; said Carlo Piana, OSI board chair. &#8220;The board is confident that the process has resulted in a definition that meets the standards of open-source as defined in the open-source definition and the four essential freedoms.&#8221;</p>



<p>One of the framework&#8217;s most significant requirements is the mandate for open-source models to provide sufficient information about <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/penguin-random-house-protects-its-books-from-ai-training-use/">their training data</a>, ensuring that &#8220;a skilled person can recreate a substantially equivalent system using the same or similar data,&#8221; according to Ayah Bdeir, who leads AI strategy at <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/">Mozilla</a>.</p>



<p>Bdeir acknowledged that whilst this approach might not be perfect, it represents a practical compromise between ideological purity and real-world implementation. She suggested that demanding an unrealistically high standard could prove counterproductive to the initiative&#8217;s goals.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/implement">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a> (DPGA) has expressed support for the OSI&#8217;s leadership in defining open-source AI. Liv Marte Nordhaug, CEO of the DPGA secretariat, confirmed that her organisation will incorporate this foundational work into updates to their Digital Public Goods Standard for AI applications.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.eleuther.ai/">EleutherAI Institute</a>, known for its non-profit work in AI development, has also endorsed the definition.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Open Source AI Definition is a necessary step towards promoting the benefits of open-source principles in the field of AI,&#8221; stated Stella Biderman, Executive Director of the EleutherAI Institute. &#8220;We believe that this definition supports the needs of independent machine learning researchers and promotes greater transparency among the largest AI developers.&#8221;</p>



<p>The definition highlights the importance of including data information and code when sharing open-source models and weights. These requirements ensure transparency and the ability to modify the AI system.</p>



<p>OSI Executive Director Stefano Maffulli acknowledged the challenges faced during the development process, noting that despite occasional heated exchanges and differing opinions, the final result aligned with the project&#8217;s initial objectives.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a starting point for a continued effort to engage with the communities to improve the definition over time,&#8221; he stated.</p>



<p>The OSAID does not require a specific legal mechanism for assuring that model parameters are freely available to all, though it may involve licences or legal instruments. This aspect is expected to become clearer over time as <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/eu-ai-act-early-prep-could-give-businesses-competitive-edge/">the legal system</a> addresses these open-source AI systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Blockchain can become a potent force as the foundation of decentralised AI systems, transparent and fair – ensuring everyone can access not only the technology, but the rewards it delivers.</p>



<p>Blockchain has enormous potential to democratise access to AI by addressing concerns around centralisation that have emerged with the growing dominance of companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.</p>



<p>Decentralised AI systems built on blockchains can help to democratise access to essential AI resources like computing power, data, and large language models. They are sorely needed too; as AI models become more powerful, their thirst for data and computing power grows, increasing the barrier of entry to the industry.</p>



<p>With blockchain, AI resources can be distributed across open, decentralised networks that anyone can access; levelling the playing field for smaller operators while fostering a spirit of openness and collaboration that’s essential to move the industry forward. Blockchain can create a more equitable system that ensures those who create the data used to train LLMs are fairly rewarded for their contributions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges in decentralised data</h2>



<p>There’s a lot to like about the prospect of a decentralised AI ecosystem, but the reality will only emerge if some of the key challenges around data access, management, and analysis in blockchain are surmounted.</p>



<p>For AI, blockchain can become a critical tool for secure, transparent, and verifiable data management, one that can be accessed by anyone. But blockchains have some architectural problems: they’re essentially a slow, single-table database that records information sequentially – not nearly flexible nor fast enough for the enormous volumes of data required by AI systems.</p>



<p>Another challenge is that blockchains don’t integrate easily with other data environments nor other blockchains. Because of this, most enterprises that use blockchains are forced to deploy an array of point solutions to extract data from the ledger, transform it into a relational format, bring it into a traditional database, and move it into a data warehouse for analysis. Meanwhile, to bring external data onto any blockchain, it’s necessary to use complex and risky data oracles. All of these tools introduce centralisation and security risks into the equation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Innovative solutions pave the way</h2>



<p>Fortunately, a number of innovative solutions are being proposed to help smooth the integration of blockchains and AI. A case in point is <a href="https://www.spaceandtime.io/">Space and Time</a>, creator of a decentralised data warehouse that replaces traditional data stacks and serves as a trustless intermediary between blockchains and enterprise data systems, enabling them to communicate seamlessly.</p>



<p>Space and Time’s secret sauce is its Proof-of-SQL consensus mechanism, which cryptographically verifies the accuracy of SQL database queries and proves the underlying dataset hasn’t been tampered with. This enables smart contracts to interact with external data, paving the way for more sophisticated blockchain applications that use AI. For example, Space and Time can enable an AI chatbot like ChatGPT to access blockchain data without any modification.</p>



<p>Formerly known for its modular AI blockchain, <a href="https://0g.ai/">OG</a> has recently rebranded itself as a ‘Decentralised AI Operating System’ called dAIOS. The system uses blockchain to coordinate decentralised resources for AI including storage, data availability, and compute power, so AI applications can operate securely and transparently on-chain while ensuring users retain control of the data that’s fed in.</p>



<p>OG’s dAIOS has three main components – storage for managing large data volumes, ‘data availability’ for data verification, and ‘serving’ to power data retrieval, training, and inference – which can be used by any developer to access the resources needed to power their AI models.</p>



<p>Looking to solve the challenge of blockchain data access, <a href="https://www.sqd.dev/">SQD</a> is the creator of an advanced data indexing tool that works by aggregating on-chain data in parquet files and distributing them across nodes in a decentralised data lake. SQD is addressing the architectural inefficiencies of blockchain, namely the way data is stored sequentially in blocks, an architecture that makes it inefficient to query.</p>



<p>Whenever an app needs access to blockchain data, it sends a query to whichever nodes hosts the desired data. Each node is assigned to a specific segment of blockchain data and SQD provides a detailed index of that information so dApps can quickly find what they need. It typically assigns the same blockchain data to multiple nodes to ensure availability, using an algorithm to manage query volumes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What will AI do for blockchain?</h2>



<p>Modern blockchain data infrastructures pave the way for a number of novel AI/blockchain applications. One of the most promising lies in security. AI can enhance blockchain security by monitoring transactions and network activity to detect anomalies in real-time, and mitigate any suspicious activity.</p>



<p>AI can also enhance the capabilities of smart contracts and make them much more intelligent. By using analytics, AI algorithms can predict any problems when they contract conditions are executed. AI-powered natural language processing algorithms can enable smart contracts to understand legal contracts. And generative AI technology can be used to automate the creation of smart contracts, eliminating the need to learn a specialised programming language like Solidity.</p>



<p>The domain of tokenised real-world assets also stands to benefit from an infusion of AI, used to analyse the provenance and condition of RWAs like stocks and fine art. By correlating the analysis with market trends, AI can more accurately calculate the fair market value of tokens. AI can also be used to monitor real-time data fees to continuously update their values. Additionally, it can be used to automate the process of converting RWAs into digital tokens.</p>



<p>Finally, AI can be used to predict future price movements of digital assets by monitoring market trends and industry news. Traders will be able to use the analysis to enhance their decision-making, hedge their investment portfolios and attempt to capitalise on market volatility.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AI for everyone</h2>



<p>The AI industry is growing at an unprecedented pace, and the need for decentralisation is becoming more important to ensure the industry remains open and competitive. Blockchain will provide the foundation for cutting-edge, decentralised AI models, leading to the creation of AI tools that cater to the needs of the majority, ones that focus on simplicity, privacy and ease-of-use.</p>



<p>“Space and Time is thrilled to lead Web3 into a new era of data-driven smart contracts and the next generation of DeFi,” <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/space-and-time-labs-raises-20m-in-series-a-funding-for-blockchain-and-ai-advancement/">said</a> Jay White PhD, Co-Founder and Head of Research at SxT, and the inventor of the Proof of SQL protocol.</p>



<p>As AI and blockchain’s convergence gathers pace, the two technologies will democratise access to AI resources, reward data contributors fairly, and allow any company to use its proprietary data securely. It’s no wonder that industry experts like Miguel Palencia, co-founder of Qtum, express nothing but confidence in their potential.</p>



<p>“Giving everyone true ownership and provenance of AI assets is of the utmost importance,” Palencia <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/05/08/web3-meets-ai-blockchain-technology-revolutionises-the-ai-landscape/">told Forbes</a>. “There is a pressing need to address the concentration of AI power in the hands of a few companies.”</p>

<p>Robust governance is essential to mitigate AI risks and maintain responsible systems, but the majority of firms are yet to implement a framework.</p>



<p>Commissioned by <a href="https://casperlabs.io/products/prove-ai">Prove AI</a> and conducted by <a href="https://zogbyanalytics.com/">Zogby Analytics</a>, the report polled over 600 CEOs, CIOs, and CTOs from large companies across the US, UK, and Germany. The findings show that 96% of organisations are already utilising AI to support business operations, with the same percentage planning to increase their AI budgets in the coming year.</p>



<p>The primary motivations for AI investment include increasing productivity (82%), improving operational efficiency (73%), enhancing decision-making (65%), and achieving cost savings (60%). The most common AI use cases reported were customer service and support, predictive analytics, and marketing and ad optimisation.</p>



<p>Despite the surge in AI investments, business leaders are acutely aware of the additional risk exposure that AI brings to their organisations. Data integrity and security emerged as the biggest deterrents to implementing new AI solutions.</p>



<p>Executives also reported encountering various AI performance issues, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Data quality issues</strong> (e.g., inconsistencies or inaccuracies): 41%</li>



<li><strong>Bias detection and mitigation challenges</strong> in AI algorithms, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes: 37%</li>



<li><strong>Difficulty in quantifying</strong> and measuring the return on investment (ROI) of AI initiatives: 28%</li>
</ul>



<p>While 95% of respondents expressed confidence in their organisation&#8217;s current AI risk management practices, the report revealed a significant gap in AI governance implementation.</p>



<p>Only 5% of executives reported that their organisation has implemented any AI governance framework. However, 82% stated that implementing AI governance solutions is a somewhat or extremely pressing priority, with 85% planning to implement such solutions by summer 2025.</p>



<p>The report also found that 82% of participants support an AI governance executive order to provide stronger oversight. Additionally, 65% expressed concern about IP infringement and data security.</p>



<p>Mrinal Manohar, CEO of Prove AI, commented: &#8220;Executives are making themselves clear: AI&#8217;s long-term efficacy, including providing a meaningful return on the massive investments organisations are currently making, is contingent on their ability to develop and refine comprehensive AI governance strategies.</p>



<p>&#8220;The wave of AI-focused legislation going into effect around the world is only increasing the urgency; for the current wave of innovation to continue responsibly, we need to implement clearer guardrails to manage and monitor the data informing AI systems.&#8221;</p>



<p>As global regulations like <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/balancing-innovation-trust-experts-assess-eu-ai-act/">the EU AI Act</a> loom on the horizon, the report underscores the importance of de-risking AI and the work that still needs to be done. Implementing and optimising dedicated AI governance strategies has emerged as a top priority for businesses looking to harness the power of AI while mitigating associated risks.</p>



<p>The findings of this report serve as a wake-up call for organisations to prioritise AI governance as they continue to invest in and deploy AI technologies. Responsible implementation and robust governance frameworks will be key to unlocking the full potential of AI while maintaining trust and compliance.</p>
