This model generates high-quality, lifelike video outputs from text or image inputs and allows organisations to create detailed outputs in fields such as fashion, architecture, and graphic design. AWS\u2019s presence as the first provider for this model ensures businesses can experiment with new camera angles, cinematographic styles, and consistent characters with a frictionless workflow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>poolside\u2019s <\/strong><strong><em>malibu<\/em><\/strong><strong> and <\/strong><strong><em>point<\/em><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed to address challenges in modern software engineering, poolside\u2019s models \u2013 <em>malibu<\/em> and <em>point<\/em> \u2013 specialise in code generation, testing, documentation, and real-time code completion. Importantly, developers can securely fine-tune these models using their private datasets. Accompanied by Assistant \u2013 an integration for development environments \u2013 poolside\u2019s tools allow engineering teams to accelerate productivity, ship projects faster, and increase accuracy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Stability AI\u2019s Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon Bedrock customers will soon gain access to Stability AI\u2019s text-to-image model <a href=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/news\/stability-ai-releases-most-powerful-image-generation-models-date\/\">Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large<\/a>. This addition supports businesses in creating high-quality visual media for use cases in areas like gaming, advertising, and retail.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the Bedrock Marketplace, AWS also enables access to over 100 specialised models. These include solutions tailored to fields such as biology (EvolutionaryScale\u2019s ESM3 generative model), financial data (Writer\u2019s Palmyra-Fin), and media (Camb.ai\u2019s text-to-audio MARS6).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"692\" src=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-1024x692.jpg\" alt=\"Image showing the expanded AI model catalog in the Amazon Bedrock Marketplace.\" class=\"wp-image-16656\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-1024x692.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-300x203.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-768x519.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-296x200.jpg 296w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-380x257.jpg 380w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-350x237.jpg 350w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-100x68.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence-60x41.jpg 60w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/amazon-bedrock-model-marketplace-catalog-ai-artificial-intelligence.jpg 1294w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Zendesk, a global customer service software firm, leverages Bedrock\u2019s marketplace to personalise support across email and social channels using AI-driven localisation and sentiment analysis tools. For example, they use models like Widn.AI to tailor responses based on real-time sentiment in customers\u2019 native languages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scaling inference with new Amazon Bedrock features<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Large-scale generative AI applications require balancing the cost, latency, and accuracy of inference processes. AWS is addressing this challenge with two new Amazon Bedrock features:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Prompt Caching<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The new caching capability reduces redundant processing of prompts by securely storing frequently used queries, saving on both time and costs. This feature can lead to up to a 90% reduction in costs and an 85% decrease in latency. For example, Adobe incorporated Prompt Caching into its Acrobat AI Assistant to summarise documents and answer questions, achieving a 72% reduction in response times during initial testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Intelligent Prompt Routing<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This feature dynamically directs prompts to the most suitable foundation model within a family, optimising results for both cost and quality. Customers such as Argo Labs, which builds conversational voice AI solutions for restaurants, have already benefited. While simpler queries (like booking tables) are handled by smaller models, more nuanced requests (e.g., dietary-specific menu questions) are intelligently routed to larger models. Argo Labs\u2019 usage of intelligent Prompt Routing has not only improved response quality but also reduced costs by up to 30%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data utilisation: Knowledge bases and automation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A key attraction of generative AI lies in its ability to extract value from data. AWS is enhancing its Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to ensure organisations can deploy their unique datasets for richer AI-powered user experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Using structured data\u00a0<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>AWS has introduced capabilities for structured data retrieval within Knowledge Bases. This enhancement allows customers to query data stored across Amazon services like SageMaker Lakehouse and Redshift through natural-language prompts, with results translated back into SQL queries. Octus, a credit intelligence firm, plans to use this capability to provide clients with dynamic, natural-language reports on its structured financial data.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>GraphRAG integration\u00a0<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By incorporating automated graph modelling (powered by Amazon Neptune), customers can now generate and connect relational data for stronger AI applications. BMW Group, for instance, will use GraphRAG to augment its virtual assistant MAIA. This assistant taps into BMW\u2019s wealth of internal data to deliver comprehensive responses and premium user experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Separately, AWS has unveiled Amazon Bedrock Data Automation, a tool that transforms unstructured content (e.g., documents, video, and audio) into structured formats for analytics or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Companies like Symbeo (automated claims processing) and Tenovos (digital asset management) are already piloting the tool to improve operational efficiency and data reuse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Amazon Bedrock Data Automation Overview | Amazon Web Services\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/s54hx76QD5k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The expansion of Amazon Bedrock\u2019s ecosystem reflects its growing popularity, with the service recording a 4.7x increase in its customer base over the last year.
