This apprehension is driving a surge in edge computing adoption, with 85% believing that security concerns will push more AI use cases to the edge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.edgecomputing-news.com\/\">Edge computing<\/a> \u2013 which processes data locally on devices instead of relying on centralised cloud systems \u2013 offers inherent advantages in efficiency, security, and privacy. However, this shift to the edge necessitates a heightened focus on device security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is an important interconnect between AI and security: one doesn\u2019t scale without the other,&#8221; cautions David Maidment, Senior Director, Market Strategy at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.arm.com\/\">Arm<\/a> (a PSA Certified co-founder). &#8220;While AI is a huge opportunity, its proliferation also offers that same opportunity to bad actors.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite recognising security as paramount, a significant disconnect exists between awareness and action. Only half (50%) of those surveyed believe their current security investments are sufficient.&nbsp; Furthermore, essential security practices, such as independent certifications and threat modelling, are being neglected by a substantial portion of respondents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s more imperative than ever that those in the connected device ecosystem don\u2019t skip best practice security in the hunt for AI features,&#8221; emphasises Maidment. &#8220;The entire value chain needs to take collective responsibility and ensure that consumer trust in AI driven services is maintained.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report highlights the need for a holistic approach to security, embedded throughout the entire AI lifecycle, from device deployment to the management of AI models operating at the edge. This proactive approach, incorporating security-by-design principles, is deemed essential to building consumer trust and mitigating the escalating security risks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the concerns, a sense of optimism prevails within the industry. A majority (67%) of decisionmakers believe their organisations are equipped to handle the potential security risks associated with AI&#8217;s surge. There is a growing recognition of the need to prioritise security investment \u2013 46% are focused on bolstering security, compared to 39% prioritising AI readiness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Those looking to unleash the full potential of AI must ensure they are taking the right steps to mitigate potential security risks,&#8221; says Maidment. &#8220;As stakeholders in the connected device ecosystem rapidly embrace a new set of AI-enabled use cases, it\u2019s crucial that they do not simply forge ahead with AI regardless of security implications.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@bradencollum?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Braden Collum<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/news\/the-ai-revolution-reshaping-data-centres-and-the-digital-landscape\/\"><strong>The AI revolution: Reshaping data centres and the digital landscape<\/strong><\/a><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11874\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png 728w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-300x37.png 300w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-380x47.png 380w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-350x43.png 350w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-100x12.png 100w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-60x7.png 60w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?<\/strong> Check out<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\"> AI &amp; Big Data Expo<\/a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
