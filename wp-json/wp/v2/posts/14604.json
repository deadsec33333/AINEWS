They autonomously decode their environments and rebuild and refine their \u201cworld models\u201d using real-time data, continuously fed to them via onboard sensors.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The rise of agentic AI<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach, and Stanhope AI\u2019s technology, are based on the neuroscience principle of Active Inference \u2013 the idea that our brains, in order to minimise free energy, are constantly making predictions about incoming sensory data around us. As this data changes, our brains adapt and update our predictions in response to rebuild and refine our world view.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is very different to the traditional machine learning methods used to train today\u2019s AI systems such as LLMs. Today\u2019s models can only operate within the realms of the training they are given, and can only make best-guess decisions based on the information they have. They can\u2019t learn on the go. They require extreme amounts of processing power and energy to train and run, as well as vast amounts of seen data.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By contrast, Stanhope AI\u2019s Active Inference models are truly autonomous. They can constantly rebuild and refine their predictions. Uncertainty is minimised by default, which removes the risk of hallucinations about what the AI <em>thinks is true<\/em>, and this moves Stanhope\u2019s unique models towards reasoning and human-like decision-making. What\u2019s more, by drastically reducing the size and energy required to run the models and the machines, Stanhope AI\u2019s models can operate on small devices such as drones and similar.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u201cThe most all-encompassing idea since natural selection\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanhope AI\u2019s approach is possible because of its founding team\u2019s extensive research into the neuroscience principles of Active Inference, as well as free energy. Director Indeed Professor Friston, a world-renowned neuroscientist at UCL whose work has been cited twice as many times as Albert Einstein, is the inventor of the Free Energy Theory Principle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friston\u2019s principle theory centres on how our brains minimise surprise and uncertainty. It explains that all living things are driven to minimise free energy, and thus the energy needed to predict and perceive the world. Such is its impact, the Free Energy Theory Principle has been described as the \u201cmost all-encompassing idea since the theory of natural selection.\u201d Active Inference sits within this theory to explain the process our brains use in order to minimise this energy. This idea infuses Stanhope AI\u2019s work, led by Professor Moran, a specialist in Active Inference and its application through AI; and Dr Biswa Sengupta, whose doctoral research was in dynamical systems, optimisation and energy efficiency from the University of Cambridge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Real-world application<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the immediate term, the technology is being tested with delivery drones and autonomous machines used by partners including Germany\u2019s Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation and the Royal Navy. In the long term, the technology holds huge promise in the realms of manufacturing, industrial robotics and embodied AI. The investment will be used to further the company\u2019s development of its agentic AI models and the practical application of its research.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Professor Rosalyn Moran, CEO and co-founder of Stanhope AI, said: &#8220;Our mission at Stanhope AI is to bridge the gap between neuroscience and artificial intelligence, creating a new generation of AI systems that can think, adapt, and decide like humans. We believe this technology will transform the capabilities of AI and robotics and make them more impactful in real-world scenarios. We trust the math and we\u2019re delighted to have the backing of investors like UCL Technology Fund who deeply understand the science behind this technology and their support will be significant on our journey to revolutionise AI technology.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Grimm, partner UCL Technology Fund, said: &#8220;AI startups may be some of the hottest investments right now but few have the calibre and deep scientific and technical know-how as the Stanhope AI team. This is emblematic of their unique approach, combining neuroscience insights with advanced AI, which presents a groundbreaking opportunity to advance the field and address some of the most challenging problems in AI today. We can\u2019t wait to see what this team achieves.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marina Santilli, sasociate director UCL Business, added \u201cThe promise offered by Stanhope AI\u2019s approach to Artificial Intelligence is hugely exciting, providing hope for powerful whilst energy-light models. UCLB is delighted to have been able to support the formation of a company built on the decades of fundamental research at UCL led by Professor Friston, developing the Free Energy Principle.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/9\/2023\/10\/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13755\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/image.png 728w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/image-300x37.png 300w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/image-380x47.png 380w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/image-350x43.png 350w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/image-100x12.png 100w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/image-60x7.png 60w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?<\/strong>&nbsp;Check out<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\">&nbsp;AI &amp; Big Data Expo<\/a>&nbsp;taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
