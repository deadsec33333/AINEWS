The decision comes as regulatory bodies intensify their scrutiny of big tech&#8217;s involvement in AI development and deployment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2024-07-10\/microsoft-quits-openai-board-after-antitrust-scrutiny-grows\">Bloomberg<\/a> report on July 10, citing an anonymous source familiar with the matter, Microsoft has officially communicated its withdrawal from the OpenAI board. This move comes approximately a year after the Redmond-based company made a substantial $13 billion investment in OpenAI in April 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a memo addressed to OpenAI, Microsoft stated: &#8220;Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company&#8217;s direction.&#8221; The tech giant added, &#8220;We no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to recent reports suggesting that Apple would <a href=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/2024\/07\/03\/apple-secures-observer-seat-openai-board\/\">secure an observer role<\/a> on OpenAI&#8217;s board as part of a landmark agreement announced in June, it appears that OpenAI will now have no board observers following Microsoft&#8217;s departure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responding to these developments, OpenAI expressed gratitude towards Microsoft, stating, &#8220;We&#8217;re grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This retreat from board involvement by major tech players occurs against a backdrop of mounting regulatory pressure. Concerns about the potential impact of big tech on AI development and industry dominance have prompted increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies worldwide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In June, European Union regulators announced that OpenAI could face an EU antitrust investigation over its partnership with Microsoft. EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/2024\/07\/01\/eu-probes-microsoft-openai-and-google-samsung-ai-deals\/\">revealed plans<\/a> for local regulators to seek additional third-party views and survey firms such as Microsoft, Google, Meta, and ByteDance&#8217;s TikTok regarding their AI partnerships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udce2 For now, we conclude that <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Microsoft?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Microsoft<\/a> has not acquired control of <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OpenAI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@OpenAI<\/a> under \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa Merger Regulation.<br><br>We will keep monitoring the relationships between all key players in the AI sector, incl.
