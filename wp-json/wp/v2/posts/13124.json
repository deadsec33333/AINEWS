It follows <a href=\"https:\/\/www.developer-tech.com\/news\/2023\/mar\/29\/over-1000-experts-call-halt-ai-development\/\">another open letter<\/a> signed by Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, and over 1,000 other experts who called for a halt to \u201cout-of-control\u201d AI development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its brevity, the latest statement does not provide specific details about the definition of AI or offer concrete strategies for mitigating the risks. However, CAIS clarified in a press release that its goal is to establish safeguards and institutions to ensure that AI risks are effectively managed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been actively engaging with global leaders and advocating for AI regulations. During a recent Senate appearance, Altman repeatedly called on lawmakers to heavily regulate the industry. The CAIS statement aligns with his efforts to raise awareness about the dangers of AI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the open letter has garnered attention, some experts in AI ethics have criticised the trend of issuing such statements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Sasha Luccioni, a machine-learning research scientist, suggests that mentioning hypothetical risks of AI alongside tangible risks like pandemics and climate change enhances its credibility while diverting attention from immediate issues like bias, legal challenges, and consent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel Jeffries, a writer and futurist, argues that discussing AI risks has become a status game in which individuals jump on the bandwagon without incurring any real costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critics believe that signing open letters about future threats allows those responsible for current AI harms to alleviate their guilt while neglecting the ethical problems associated with AI technologies already in use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, CAIS \u2013 a San Francisco-based nonprofit \u2013 remains focused on reducing societal-scale risks from AI through technical research and advocacy. The organisation was co-founded by experts with backgrounds in computer science and a keen interest in AI safety.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some researchers fear the emergence of a superintelligent AI that could surpass human capabilities and pose an existential threat, others argue that signing open letters about hypothetical doomsday scenarios distracts from the existing ethical dilemmas surrounding AI. They emphasise the need to address the real problems AI poses today, such as surveillance, biased algorithms, and the infringement of human rights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Balancing the advancement of AI with responsible implementation and regulation remains a crucial task for researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders alike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@apolophotographer?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Apolo Photographer<\/a> on <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/HRYxvYDwxMc?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/2023\/05\/16\/openai-ceo-ai-regulation-is-essential\/\"><strong>OpenAI CEO: AI regulation \u2018is essential\u2019<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/9\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11874\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png 728w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-300x37.png 300w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-380x47.png 380w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-350x43.png 350w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-100x12.png 100w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-60x7.png 60w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?<\/strong> Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo<\/a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
