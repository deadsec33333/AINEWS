Son asserted that by 2030, AI could be &#8220;one to 10 times smarter than humans,&#8221; and by 2035, it might reach a staggering &#8220;10,000 times smarter&#8221; than human intelligence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SoftBank\u2019s CEO made a clear distinction between artificial general intelligence (AGI) and ASI. According to Son, AGI would be equivalent to a human &#8220;genius,&#8221; potentially up to 10 times more capable than an average person. ASI, however, would be in a league of its own, with capabilities 10,000 times beyond human potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Son&#8217;s predictions align with the goals of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/2024\/06\/20\/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskevers-startup-aims-safe-superintelligence\/\">Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI)<\/a>, founded by Ilya Sutskever, former chief scientist at OpenAI, along with Daniel Levy and Daniel Gross. SSI&#8217;s mission, as stated on their website, is to &#8220;approach safety and capabilities in tandem, as technical problems to be solved through revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The timing of these announcements underscores the growing focus on superintelligent AI within the tech industry. While SoftBank appears to be prioritising the development of ASI, SSI is emphasising the importance of safety in this pursuit. As stated by SSI&#8217;s founders, &#8220;We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the scientific community has yet to reach a consensus on the feasibility or capabilities of AGI or ASI. Current AI systems, while impressive in specific domains, are still far from achieving human-level reasoning across all areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Son&#8217;s speech took an unexpectedly personal turn when he linked the development of ASI to his own sense of purpose and mortality. &#8220;SoftBank was founded for what purpose? For what purpose was Masayoshi Son born? It may sound strange, but I think I was born to realise ASI. I am super serious about it,&#8221; he declared.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Son&#8217;s predictions and SoftBank&#8217;s apparent pivot towards ASI development, coupled with the formation of SSI, raise important questions about the future of AI and its potential impact on society. While the promise of superintelligent AI is enticing, it also brings concerns about job displacement, ethical considerations, and the potential risks associated with creating an intelligence that far surpasses our own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether Son&#8217;s vision of ASI within a decade proves prescient or overly optimistic remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the race towards superintelligent AI is heating up, with major players positioning themselves at the forefront.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/2024\/06\/21\/anthropics-claude-3-5-sonnet-beats-gpt-4o-most-benchmarks\/\"><strong>Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet beats GPT-4o in most benchmarks<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/9\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11874\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png 728w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-300x37.png 300w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-380x47.png 380w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-350x43.png 350w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-100x12.png 100w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-60x7.png 60w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?<\/strong> Check out<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\"> AI &amp; Big Data Expo<\/a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
