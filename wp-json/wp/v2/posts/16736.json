Similarly, the Ministry of Justice is utilising algorithms to help researchers gain a deeper understanding of how individuals interact with the justice system, while other departments are deploying AI to enhance job advertisements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ATRS aims to document how such algorithmic tools are utilised and ensure their responsible application. By doing so, the government hopes to strengthen public trust in these innovations while encouraging their continued adoption across sectors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking on the government\u2019s approach, Science Secretary Peter Kyle remarked:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>&#8220;Technology has huge potential to transform public services for the better; we will put it to use to cut backlogs, save money, and improve outcomes for citizens across the country.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Transparency in how and why the public sector is using algorithmic tools is crucial to ensure that they are trusted and effective. That is why we will continue to take bold steps like releasing these records to make sure everyone is clear on how we are applying and trialling technology as we use it to bring public services back from the brink.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, the Department for Business and Trade has highlighted its algorithmic tool designed to predict which companies are likely to export goods internationally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AI-driven approach allows officials to target support towards high-growth potential businesses, enabling them to reach global markets faster. Previously reliant on time-consuming manual methods to analyse the more than five million companies registered on Companies House, this advancement ensures better allocation of resources and expedited assistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>&#8220;Our Plan for Change will deliver economic growth, and for that to succeed, we need to support companies across the UK to realise their full potential when it comes to exporting around the globe.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Our use of AI plays a vital and growing role in that mission, allowing high-growth businesses to maximise the export opportunities available to them, while ensuring that we are using taxpayers\u2019 money responsibly and efficiently in delivering economic stability.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Establishing clear guidelines for AI in public services<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To bolster public trust, new guidelines have been announced to clarify the scope of algorithmic transparency records.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Central government organisations will need to publish a record for any algorithmic tool that interacts directly with citizens or plays a significant role in decision-making about individuals. Limited exceptions, such as those concerning national security, apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These records will be published once tools are piloted publicly or have become operational. They will detail the data used to train AI models, the underlying technologies, and the measures implemented to mitigate risks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, the records also seek to confirm that \u2013 while AI tools are used to accelerate decision-making processes \u2013 human oversight remains integral, with trained staff responsible for final decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Antonio Espingardeiro, a member of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ieee.org\/\">IEEE<\/a> and an expert in software and robotics, commented:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>&#8220;AI has the potential to radically transform the public sector. In recent years, we have seen AI become a credible part of everyday public services. As it becomes more sophisticated, AI can conduct data-heavy tasks traditionally undertaken by humans. It can analyse vast quantities of information and, when coupled with machine learning, search through records and infer patterns or anomalies in data that would otherwise take decades for humans to analyse.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>With this announcement, the UK government has acknowledged AI\u2019s potential and proven that technology investment is essential to improving outcomes and the delivery of vital services. Over time, machine learning and generative AI (GenAI) could bring substantial value to the public system. With increased adoption, we will soon be able to deliver the scalability that the public sector needs and relieve the pressures and workloads placed on staff.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Eleanor Watson, also a member of IEEE and an AI ethics engineer affiliated with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.su.org\/\">Singularity University<\/a>, added:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>&#8220;With AI growing more rapidly than ever before, and already being tested and employed in education, healthcare, transportation, finance, data security, and more, the government, tech leaders, and academia should work together to establish standards and regulations for safe and responsible development of AI-based systems. This way, AI can be used to its full potential as indicated with this latest announcement.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Data privacy is probably the most critical ethical consideration, requiring informed consent, data anonymisation, strict access controls, secure storage, and compliance. New techniques such as homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, federated learning, and part-trained models can help models to make use of our personal data in an encrypted form.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Transparency remains a key tenet of the UK Government\u2019s AI strategy. This announcement follows a recent statement by Pat McFadden, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who affirmed that the benefits of technology \u2013 particularly AI \u2013 must span both public and private sectors and be used to modernise government.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the Science Secretary\u2019s department solidifies government efforts to create a &#8220;digital centre,&#8221; it marks a major step forward in boosting the responsible and effective use of AI across the UK\u2019s public sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ATRS records offer a valuable template for how governments worldwide can deploy AI systems to maximise efficiency, grow transparency, and balance the need for innovation with ethical considerations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@shreyasdbz?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Shreyas Sane<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>See also: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/news\/mhra-pilots-ai-airlock-accelerate-healthcare-adoption\/\"><strong>MHRA pilots \u2018AI Airlock\u2019 to accelerate healthcare adoption<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11874\" style=\"width:1082px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png 728w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-300x37.png 300w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-380x47.png 380w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-350x43.png 350w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-100x12.png 100w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-60x7.png 60w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?<\/strong> Check out<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\"> AI &amp; Big Data Expo<\/a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
