I couldn\u2019t be more pleased to welcome the Nuance team to our Microsoft family.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nuance became a household name (in techie households, anyway) for creating the speech recognition engine that powers Apple&#8217;s smart assistant, Siri. However, Nuance has been in the speech recognition business since 2001 when it was known as ScanSoft.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it may not have made many big headlines in recent years, Nuance has continued to make some impressive advancements\u2014which caught the attention of Microsoft.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Nuance for $19.7 billion last year, in the company\u2019s largest deal after its $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn (both deals would be blown out the water by Microsoft\u2019s proposed $70 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposed acquisition of Nuance caught the attention of global regulators. It was cleared in the US relatively quickly, while the EU\u2019s regulator got in the festive spirit and <a href=\"https:\/\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/2021\/12\/22\/eu-clears-19-7b-microsoft-nuance-deal-without-small-print\/\">cleared the deal<\/a> just prior to last Christmas. The UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority finally gave it a thumbs-up last week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regulators examined whether there may be anti-competition concerns in some verticals where both companies are active, such as healthcare. However, after investigation, the regulators determined that competition shouldn\u2019t be affected by the deal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU, for example, determined that \u201ccompeting transcription service providers in healthcare do not depend on Microsoft for cloud computing services\u201d and that \u201ctranscription service providers in the healthcare sector are not particularly important users of cloud computing services\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the EU\u2019s regulator concluded:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Microsoft-Nuance will continue to face stiff competition from rivals in the future.<\/li><li>There\u2019d be no ability\/incentive to foreclose existing market solutions.<\/li><li>Nuance can only use the data it collects for its own services.<\/li><li>The data will not provide Microsoft with an advantage to shut out competing software providers.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The companies appear keen to ensure that people are aware the deal is about more than just healthcare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCombining the power of Nuance\u2019s deep vertical expertise and proven business outcomes across healthcare, financial services, retail, telecommunications, and other industries with Microsoft\u2019s global cloud ecosystems will enable us to accelerate our innovation and deploy our solutions more quickly, more seamlessly, and at greater scale to solve our customers\u2019 most pressing challenges,\u201d said Mark Benjamin, CEO of Nuance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benjamin will remain the CEO of Nuance and will report to Guthrie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@omidarmin?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Omid Armin<\/a> on <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"204\" height=\"64\" src=\"http:\/\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/9\/2021\/12\/ai-big-data-expo-no-series.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11490\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ai-big-data-expo-no-series.jpg 204w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ai-big-data-expo-no-series-100x31.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ai-big-data-expo-no-series-60x19.jpg 60w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?<\/strong> Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/northamerica\/\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo<\/a>.
