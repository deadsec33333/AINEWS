Clearview AI&#8217;s technology allows law enforcement to upload a photo of a suspect&#8217;s face and find matches in a database of billions of images it has collected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearview AI CEO Hoan Ton-That disclosed in an interview with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/technology-65057011\">BBC<\/a> that the firm has scraped 30 billion images from platforms such as Facebook. The images were taken without the users&#8217; permission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has been repeatedly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/2022\/05\/23\/uk-fines-clearview-ai-7-5m-for-scraping-citizens-data\/\">fined millions<\/a> in Europe and Australia for breaches of privacy, but US police are still using its powerful software.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthew Guaragilia from the Electronic Frontier Foundation said that police use of Clearview puts everyone into a &#8220;perpetual police line-up.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the use of facial recognition by the police is often sold to the public as being used only for serious or violent crimes, Miami Police confirmed to the BBC that it uses Clearview AI&#8217;s software for every type of crime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miami\u2019s Assistant Chief of Police Armando Aguilar said his team used Clearview AI\u2019s system about 450 times a year, and that it had helped to solve several murders.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are numerous documented cases of mistaken identity using facial recognition by the police. Robert Williams, for example, <a href=\"https:\/\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/2020\/06\/25\/aclu-uncovers-wrongful-arrest-ai-error\/\">was wrongfully arrested<\/a> on his lawn in front of his family and held overnight in a \u201ccrowded and filthy\u201d cell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe perils of face recognition technology are not hypothetical \u2014 study after study and real-life have already shown us its dangers,\u201d explained Kate Ruane, Senior Legislative Counsel for the ACLU, following <a href=\"https:\/\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/2021\/06\/17\/reintroduction-facial-recognition-legislation-mixed-responses\/\">the reintroduction<\/a> of the Facial Recognition and Biometric Technology Moratorium Act.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe technology\u2019s alarming rate of inaccuracy when used against people of colour has led to the wrongful arrests of multiple black men including Robert Williams, an ACLU client.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of transparency around police use of facial recognition means the true figure of wrongful arrests it\u2019s led to is likely far higher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Civil rights campaigners want police forces that use Clearview AI to openly say when it is used, and for its accuracy to be openly tested in court. They want the systems to be scrutinised by independent experts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of facial recognition technology by police is a contentious issue. While it may help solve crimes, it also poses a threat to civil liberties and privacy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s a fine line between using technology to fight crime and infringing on individual rights, and we need to tread carefully to ensure we don&#8217;t cross it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/2020\/03\/06\/clearview-ai-lawyer-common-law-has-never-recognised-a-right-to-privacy-for-your-face\/\"><strong>Clearview AI lawyer: \u2018Common law has never recognised a right to privacy for your face\u2019<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/9\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11874\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png 728w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-300x37.png 300w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-380x47.png 380w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-350x43.png 350w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-100x12.png 100w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-60x7.png 60w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?<\/strong> Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo<\/a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
