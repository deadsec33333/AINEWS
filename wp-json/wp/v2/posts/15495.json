The research aimed to &#8220;learn from participants&#8217; experiences and better understand both the potential and the limitations of unconditional cash transfers.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study \u2013 which provided participants with an extra $1,000 per month \u2013 revealed significant impacts across various aspects of recipients&#8217; lives, including health, spending habits, employment, personal agency, and housing mobility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In healthcare, the analysis showed increased utilisation of medical services, particularly in dental and specialist care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One participant noted, &#8220;I got myself braces&#8230;I feel like people underestimate the importance of having nice teeth because it affects more than just your own sense of self, it affects how people look at you.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While no immediate measurable effects on physical health were observed, researchers suggest that increased medical care utilisation could lead to long-term health benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study also uncovered interesting spending patterns among UBI recipients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On average, participants increased their overall monthly spending by $310, with significant allocations towards basic needs such as food, transportation, and rent. Notably, there was a 26% increase in financial support provided to others, highlighting the ripple effect of UBI on communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of employment, the study revealed nuanced outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there was a slight decrease in overall employment rates and work hours among recipients, the study found that UBI provided individuals with greater flexibility in making employment decisions aligned with their circumstances and goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One participant explained, &#8220;Because of that money and being able to build up my savings, I&#8217;m in a position for once to be picky\u2026I don&#8217;t have to take a crappy job just because I need income right now.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research also uncovered significant improvements in personal agency and future planning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>UBI recipients were 14% more likely to pursue education or job training and 5% more likely to have a budget compared to the control group. Black recipients in the third year of the program were 26% more likely to report starting or helping to start a business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, the study&#8217;s analysis revealed increased housing mobility among UBI recipients. Participants were 11% more likely to move neighbourhoods and 23% more likely to actively search for new housing compared to the control group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">the openresearch team releases the first result from their UBI study:<a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/8YXBwVeQeW\">https:\/\/t.co\/8YXBwVeQeW<\/a><br><br>great, diligent work over the past few years. proud of the team!<\/p>&mdash; Sam Altman (@sama) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sama\/status\/1815432708568608946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 22, 2024<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The study provides valuable insights into the potential impacts of UBI, offering policymakers and researchers a data-driven foundation for future decisions on social welfare programs.
