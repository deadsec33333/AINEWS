The announcement comes as part of a broader strategy to strengthen the UK&#8217;s cyber defence capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking at the NATO Cyber Defence Conference at Lancaster House, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said: &#8220;NATO needs to continue to adapt to the world of AI, because as the tech evolves, the threat evolves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNATO has stayed relevant over the last seven decades by constantly adapting to new threats. It has navigated the worlds of nuclear proliferation and militant nationalism. The move from cold warfare to drone warfare.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chancellor painted a stark picture of the current cyber security landscape, stating: &#8220;Cyber war is now a daily reality. One where our defences are constantly being tested. The extent of the threat must be matched by the strength of our resolve to combat it and to protect our citizens and systems.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new laboratory will operate under a &#8216;catalytic&#8217; model, designed to attract additional investment and collaboration from industry partners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key stakeholders in the new lab include GCHQ, the National Cyber Security Centre, the MOD&#8217;s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, and prestigious academic institutions such as the University of Oxford and Queen&#8217;s University Belfast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a direct warning about Russia&#8217;s activities, the Chancellor declared: &#8220;Be in no doubt: the United Kingdom and others in this room are watching Russia. We know exactly what they are doing, and we are countering their attacks both publicly and behind the scenes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We know from history that appeasing dictators engaged in aggression against their neighbours only encourages them. Britain learned long ago the importance of standing strong in the face of such actions.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reaffirming support for Ukraine, he added, &#8220;Putin is a man who wants destruction, not peace. He is trying to deter our support for Ukraine with his threats. He will not be successful.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new lab follows recent concerns about state actors using AI to bolster existing security threats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Last year, we saw the US for the first time publicly call out a state for using AI to aid its malicious cyber activity,&#8221; the Chancellor noted, referring to North Korea&#8217;s attempts to use AI for malware development and vulnerability scanning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stephen Doughty, Minister for Europe, North America and UK Overseas Territories, highlighted the dual nature of AI technology: &#8220;AI has enormous potential. To ensure it remains a force for good in the world, we need to understand its threats and its opportunities.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside LASR, the government announced a new \u00a31 million incident response project to enhance collaborative cyber defence capabilities among allies. The laboratory will prioritise collaboration with Five Eyes countries and NATO allies, building on the UK&#8217;s historical strength in computing, dating back to Alan Turing&#8217;s groundbreaking work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initiative forms part of the government&#8217;s comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, which includes the upcoming <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/collections\/cyber-security-and-resilience-bill\">Cyber Security and Resilience Bill<\/a> and the recent classification of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/news\/uk-secures-6-3b-data-infrastructure-investments\/\">data centres<\/a> as critical national infrastructure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@introspectivedsgn?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Erik Mclean<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/news\/anthropic-urges-ai-regulation-avoid-catastrophes\/\"><strong>Anthropic urges AI regulation to avoid catastrophes<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11874\" style=\"width:969px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png 728w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-300x37.png 300w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-380x47.png 380w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-350x43.png 350w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-100x12.png 100w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-60x7.png 60w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?<\/strong> Check out<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\"> AI &amp; Big Data Expo<\/a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
