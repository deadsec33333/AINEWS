Seamless integration is cited as a crucial factor, with many preferring tools that work cohesively with existing systems. \u201cGenAI\u2019s value is linked to how well it works within the broader technology ecosystem,\u201d the report states.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, almost two-thirds (63%) of those surveyed expressed willingness to switch security vendors to access GenAI capabilities from competitors. The survey underscores the industry\u2019s readiness for unified platforms that streamline operations and reduce the complexity of adopting new point solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>GenAI built by cybersecurity experts is a must<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Security teams believe GenAI tools should be specifically designed for cybersecurity, not general-purpose systems. 83% of respondents reported they would not trust tools that provide \u201cunsuitable or ill-advised security guidance.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Breach prevention remains a key motivator, with 74% stating they had faced breaches within the past 18 months or were concerned about vulnerabilities. Respondents prioritised tools from vendors with proven expertise in cybersecurity, incident response, and threat intelligence over suppliers with broad AI leadership alone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As CrowdStrike summarised, \u201cThe emphasis on breach prevention and vendor expertise suggests security teams would avoid domain-agnostic GenAI tools.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Augmentation, not replacement\u00a0<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite growing fears of automation replacing jobs in many industries, the survey\u2019s findings indicate minimal concerns about job displacement in cybersecurity. Instead, respondents expect GenAI to empower security analysts by automating repetitive tasks, reducing burnout, onboarding new personnel faster, and accelerating decision-making.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GenAI\u2019s potential for augmenting analysts\u2019 workflows was underscored by its most requested applications: threat intelligence analysis, assistance with investigations, and automated response mechanisms. As noted in the report, \u201cRespondents overwhelmingly believe GenAI will ultimately optimise the analyst experience, not replace human labour.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>ROI outweighs cost concerns\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For organisations evaluating GenAI investments, measurable return on investment (ROI) is the paramount concern, ahead of licensing costs or pricing model confusion. Respondents expect platform-led GenAI deployments to deliver faster results, thanks to cost savings from reduced tool management burdens, streamlined training, and fewer security incidents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the survey data, the expected ROI breakdown includes 31% from cost optimisation and more efficient tools, 30% from fewer incidents, and 26% from reduced management time. Security leaders are clearly focused on ensuring the financial justification for GenAI investments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"5\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Guardrails and safety are crucial\u00a0<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>GenAI adoption is tempered by concerns around safety and privacy, with 87% of organisations either implementing or planning new security policies to oversee GenAI use. Key risks include exposing sensitive data to large language models (LLMs) and adversarial attacks on GenAI tools. Respondents rank safety and privacy controls among their most desired GenAI features, highlighting the need for responsible implementation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reflecting the cautious optimism of practitioners, only 39% of respondents firmly believed that the rewards of GenAI outweigh its risks. Meanwhile, 40% considered the risks and rewards \u201ccomparable.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Current state of GenAI adoption in cybersecurity<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>GenAI adoption remains in its early stages, but interest is growing. 64% of respondents are actively researching or have already invested in GenAI tools, and 69% of those currently evaluating their options plan to make a purchase within the year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security teams are primarily driven by three concerns: improving attack detection and response, enhancing operational efficiency, and mitigating the impact of staff shortages. Among economic considerations, the top priority is ROI \u2013 a sign that security leaders are keen to demonstrate tangible benefits to justify their spending.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CrowdStrike emphasises the importance of a platform-based approach, where GenAI is integrated into a unified system. Such platforms enable seamless adoption, measurable benefits, and safety guardrails for responsible usage. According to the report, \u201cThe future of GenAI in cybersecurity will be defined by tools that not only advance security but also uphold the highest standards of safety and privacy.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CrowdStrike survey concludes by affirming that \u201cGenAI is not a silver bullet\u201d but has tremendous potential to improve cybersecurity outcomes. As organisations evaluate its adoption, they will prioritise tools that integrate seamlessly with existing platforms, deliver faster response times, and ensure safety and privacy compliance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With threats becoming more sophisticated, the role of GenAI in enabling security teams to work faster and smarter could prove indispensable. While still in its infancy, GenAI in cybersecurity is poised to shift from early adoption to mainstream deployment, provided organisations and vendors address its risks responsibly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/news\/keys-ai-success-security-sustainability-overcoming-silos\/\"><strong>Keys to AI success: Security, sustainability, and overcoming silos<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11874\" style=\"width:1203px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png 728w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-300x37.png 300w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-380x47.png 380w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-350x43.png 350w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-100x12.png 100w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-60x7.png 60w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?<\/strong> Check out<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\"> AI &amp; Big Data Expo<\/a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
