The\nfunding opportunity focuses on 18 DOE Office of Science user facilities,\ncomprising of particle accelerators, accelerator test facilities, x-ray light\nsources, neutron scattering sources, and nanoscale science research centres, overseen\nby three major programme offices: basic energy sciences, high energy physics,\nand nuclear physics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ericsson.com\/en\/blog\/2020\/2\/ai-network-management-energy-costs\">latest Ericsson Mobility Report<\/a>,\n data volumes in mobile networks are increasing at an exceptional rate \nand mobile data traffic is expected to grow fourfold by 2025, reaching \nup to 160 exabytes per month. This seems interesting and in fact offers \nall sorts of opportunities for communications service providers; \nhowever, there is a potential disadvantage of this rapidly increasing \ndata traffic due to the impact on energy consumption and carbon \nfootprint of mobile networks. But AI has the ability to solve this \nproblem, Ericsson notes, as when deployed, communications service \nproviders will be able to realise energy efficiencies on the radio \nnetwork proactively. The technology does not just address site-related \nenergy savings, but also operational efficiencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo by&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@bonniekdesign?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\"><em>Bonnie Kittle<\/em><\/a><em>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/s\/photos\/usa-flag?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\"><em>Unsplash<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"241\" height=\"80\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/co-located-grey-small.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5949\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\">\n<p><strong>Interested in hearing industry leaders discuss subjects like this?<\/strong>&nbsp;Attend the co-located&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/5gexpo.net\/northamerica\/\">5G Expo<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.iottechexpo.com\/\">IoT Tech Expo<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/blockchain-expo.com\/\">Blockchain Expo<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo<\/a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cybersecuritycloudexpo.com\/\">Cyber Security &amp; Cloud Expo World Series<\/a>&nbsp;with upcoming events in Silicon Valle<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The US Department of Energy (DOE) has decided to provide funds up to $40 million over a three-year period for new research in data, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning to address the challenges associated with issues related to data production and management at DOE scientific user facilities.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":399,"featured_media":9455,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0,"_uf_show_specific_survey":0,"_uf_disable_surveys":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[181],"tags":[],"ppma_author":[2402],"class_list":["post-9454","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ai-energy"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v24.1 -
