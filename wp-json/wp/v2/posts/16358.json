Businesses will be classified primarily as either \u2018Providers\u2019 or \u2018Deployers,\u2019 with additional categories for \u2018Distributors,\u2019 \u2018Importers,\u2019 \u2018Product Manufacturers,\u2019 and \u2018Authorised Representatives.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For organisations developing or deploying AI systems, particularly those classified as high-risk, compliance preparation promises to be complex. However, experts suggest viewing this as an opportunity rather than a burden.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;By embracing compliance as a catalyst for more transparent AI usage, businesses can turn regulatory demands into a competitive advantage,&#8221; notes the DPO Centre.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key preparation strategies include comprehensive staff training, establishing robust corporate governance, and implementing strong cybersecurity measures. The legislation&#8217;s requirements often overlap with existing GDPR frameworks, particularly regarding transparency and accountability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organisations must also adhere to ethical AI principles and maintain clear documentation of their systems&#8217; functionality, limitations, and intended use. The EU is currently developing specific codes of practice and templates to assist with compliance obligations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For businesses uncertain about their obligations, experts recommend seeking professional guidance early. Tools like the EU AI Act Compliance Checker can help organisations verify their systems&#8217; alignment with regulatory requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than viewing compliance as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/news\/tech-industry-giants-urge-eu-streamline-ai-regulations\/\">merely a regulatory burden<\/a>, forward-thinking organisations should view the EU\u2019s AI Act <a href=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/news\/balancing-innovation-trust-experts-assess-eu-ai-act\/\">as an opportunity<\/a> to demonstrate commitment to responsible AI development and build greater trust with their customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/news\/ai-governance-gap-95-of-firms-havent-frameworks\/\"><strong>AI governance gap: 95% of firms haven\u2019t implemented frameworks<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11874\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png 728w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-300x37.png 300w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-380x47.png 380w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-350x43.png 350w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-100x12.png 100w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01-60x7.png 60w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?<\/strong> Check out<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/\"> AI &amp; Big Data Expo<\/a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
