He completed his PhD at Oxford, where he designed VGGNet and then sold his first company to DeepMind,\u201d continued Suleyman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe created and led the deep learning scaling team and played a key role in such breakthroughs as AlphaZero, AlphaFold, WaveNet, and BigGAN.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inflection AI will focus on machine learning and natural language processing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cRecent advances in artificial intelligence promise to fundamentally redefine human-machine interaction,\u201d explains Suleyman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe will soon have the ability to relay our thoughts and ideas to computers using the same natural, conversational language we use to communicate with people. Over time these new language capabilities will revolutionise what it means to have a digital experience.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interest in natural language processing is surging. This month, Microsoft <a href=\"https:\/\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/2022\/03\/08\/microsoft-acquires-nuance-new-era-outcomes-based-ai\/\">completed its $19.7 billion acquisition<\/a> of Siri voice recognition engine creator Nuance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suleyman <a href=\"https:\/\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/2022\/01\/21\/deepmind-co-founder-mustafa-suleyman-departs-google\/\">departed Google<\/a> in January 2022 following an eight-year stint at the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While at Google, Suleyman was placed on administrative leave following bullying allegations. During <a href=\"https:\/\/greylock.com\/firm-news\/welcome-mustafa-suleyman\/\">a podcast<\/a>, he said that he \u201creally screwed up\u201d and was \u201cvery sorry about the impact that caused people and the hurt people felt.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suleyman joined venture capital firm Greylock after leaving Google.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere are few people who are as visionary, knowledgeable and connected across the vast artificial intelligence landscape as Mustafa,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/greylock.com\/firm-news\/welcome-mustafa-suleyman\/\">wrote<\/a> Hoffman, a Greylock partner, in a post at the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMustafa has spent years thinking about how technological advances impact society, and he cares deeply about the ethics and governance supporting new AI systems.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inflection AI was incubated by Greylock. Suleyman and Hoffman will both remain venture partners at the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suleyman promises that more details about Inflection AI\u2019s product plans will be provided over the coming months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"204\" height=\"64\" src=\"http:\/\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/9\/2021\/12\/ai-big-data-expo-no-series.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11490\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ai-big-data-expo-no-series.jpg 204w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ai-big-data-expo-no-series-100x31.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ai-big-data-expo-no-series-60x19.jpg 60w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?<\/strong> Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/northamerica\/\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo<\/a>.
