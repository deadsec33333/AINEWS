While the US and China are set to dominate AI development with their vast resources, economic might, and light-touch regulation, European rivals \u2013 including the UK and EU members \u2013 believe they can lead in ethical standards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the draft of the EU regulations, companies that are found guilty of AI misuse face a fine of \u20ac30 million or six percent of their global turnover (whichever is greater). The risk of such fines has been criticised as driving investments away from Europe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU\u2019s draft AI regulation classifies systems into three risk categories:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Limited risk \u2013 includes systems like chatbots, inventory management, spam filters, and video games.<\/li><li>High risk \u2013 includes systems that make vital decisions like evaluating creditworthiness, recruitment, justice administration, and biometric identification in non-public spaces.<\/li><li>Unacceptable risk \u2013 includes systems that are manipulative or exploitative, create social scoring, or conduct real-time biometric authentication in public spaces for law enforcement.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Unacceptable risk systems will face a blanket ban from deployment in the EU while limited risk will require minimal oversight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organisations deploying high-risk AI systems would be required to have things like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Human oversight.<\/li><li>A risk-management system.<\/li><li>Record keeping and logging.<\/li><li>Transparency to users.<\/li><li>Data governance and management.<\/li><li>Conformity assessment.<\/li><li>Government registration.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the cumbersome nature of the EU \u2013 requiring agreement from all member states, each with their own priorities \u2013 means that new regulations are often subject to more debate and delay than national lawmaking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reuters <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/europe\/europes-bid-ai-standard-faces-long-road-eu-lawmakers-say-2022-02-16\/\">reports<\/a> that two key lawmakers on Wednesday said the EU\u2019s AI regulations will likely take over a year more to agree. The delay is primarily due to debates over whether facial recognition should be banned and who should enforce the rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Facial recognition is going to be the biggest ideological discussion between the right and left,&#8221; said one lawmaker, Dragos Tudorache, in a Reuters interview.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in an outright ban. For me, the solution is to put the right rules in place.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With leading academic institutions and more than 1,300 AI companies employing over 30,000 people, the UK is the biggest destination for AI investment in Europe and the third in the world. Between January and June 2021, global investors poured \u00a313.5 billion into more than 1,400 \u201cdeep tech\u201d UK private technology firms\u2014more than Germany, France, and Israel combined.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September 2021, the UK published its <a href=\"https:\/\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/2021\/09\/23\/uk-sets-out-its-10-year-plan-to-remain-a-global-ai-superpower\/\">10-year National Artificial Intelligence Strategy<\/a> in a bid to secure its European AI leadership. Governance plays a large role in the strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe UK already punches above its weight internationally and we are ranked third in the world behind the USA and China in the list of top countries for AI,\u201d commented DCMS Minister Chris Philp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re laying the foundations for the next ten years\u2019 growth with a strategy to help us seize the potential of artificial intelligence and play a leading role in shaping the way the world governs it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of its strategy, the UK is creating an \u2018AI Standards Hub\u2019 to coordinate the country\u2019s engagement in establishing global rules and is working with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.turing.ac.uk\/\">The Alan Turing Institute<\/a> to update guidance on AI ethics and safety.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are proud of creating a dynamic, collaborative community of diverse researchers and are growing world-leading capabilities in responsible, safe, ethical, and inclusive AI research and innovation,\u201d said Professor Sir Adrian Smith, Chief Executive of The Alan Turing Institute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Striking a balance between innovation-stifling overregulation and ethics-compromising underregulation is never a simple task. It will be interesting to observe how AI regulations in Europe will differ across the continent and beyond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Photo by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@christianlue?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Christian Lue<\/a>\u00a0on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/2021\/02\/25\/british-intelligence-agency-gchq-ethics-of-ai-report\/\"><strong>British intelligence agency GCHQ publishes \u2018Ethics of AI\u2019 report<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"204\" height=\"64\" src=\"http:\/\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/9\/2021\/12\/ai-big-data-expo-no-series.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11490\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ai-big-data-expo-no-series.jpg 204w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ai-big-data-expo-no-series-100x31.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ai-big-data-expo-no-series-60x19.jpg 60w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?<\/strong> Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/northamerica\/\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo<\/a>.
