The notice means that it will be granted the patent once it pays the administration fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearview AI offers one of the most powerful facial recognition systems in the world. In the wake of the US Capitol raid, Clearview AI <a href=\"https:\/\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/2021\/01\/11\/police-use-clearview-ai-facial-recognition-increased-26-capitol-raid\/\">boasted<\/a> that police use of its facial recognition system increased 26 percent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The controversy around Clearview AI is that \u2013 aside from some <a href=\"https:\/\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/2020\/04\/08\/clearview-ai-found-extensive-ties-far-right\/\">potential far-right links<\/a> \u2013 its system uses over 10 billion photos scraped from online web profiles without the explicit consent of the individuals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCommon law has never recognised a right to privacy for your face,\u201d Clearview AI lawyer Tor Ekeland once <a href=\"https:\/\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/2020\/03\/06\/clearview-ai-lawyer-common-law-has-never-recognised-a-right-to-privacy-for-your-face\/\">argued<\/a>. Ekeland, it\u2019s worth noting, gained notoriety as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2015\/01\/the-trolls-lawyer\/\">\u201cThe Troll\u2019s Lawyer\u201d<\/a> after defending clients including self-described neo-Nazi troll Andrew Auernheimer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u2018Unreasonably intrusive and unfair\u2019<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month, the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) <a href=\"https:\/\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/2021\/11\/30\/clearview-ai-could-be-fined-17m-from-uk-privacy-watchdog\/\">imposed a potential fine<\/a> of just over \u00a317 million to Clearview AI and ordered the company to destroy the personal data it holds on British citizens and cease further processing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaked documents suggest Clearview AI\u2019s system was tested by UK authorities including the Metropolitan Police, Ministry of Defense, the National Crime Agency, and a number of police constabularies including Surrey, North Yorkshire, Suffolk, and Northamptonshire. However, the system is said to no longer be being used or tested in the UK.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUK data protection legislation does not stop the effective use of technology to fight crime, but to enjoy public trust and confidence in their products technology providers must ensure people\u2019s legal protections are respected and complied with,\u201d commented UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK\u2019s decision was the result of a joint probe launched with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) into Cleaview AI\u2019s practices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier in the month, the OAIC <a href=\"https:\/\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/2021\/11\/04\/uk-aus-probe-finds-clearview-ai-fails-comply-privacy-regs\/\">reached the same conclusion<\/a> as the ICO and ordered Clearview AI to to destroy the biometric data that it collected on Australians and cease further collection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI consider that the act of uploading an image to a social media site does not unambiguously indicate agreement to collection of that image by an unknown third party for commercial purposes,\u201d said Australia\u2019s Information Commissioner Angelene Falk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe covert collection of this kind of sensitive information is unreasonably intrusive and unfair,\u201d Falk said. \u201cIt carries significant risk of harm to individuals, including vulnerable groups such as children and victims of crime, whose images can be searched on Clearview AI\u2019s database.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The first patent \u2018around the use of large-scale internet data\u2019<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Major web companies like Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Venmo sent cease-and-desist letters to Clearview AI demanding the company stops scraping photos and data from their platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearview AI founder Hoan Ton-That is unabashedly proud of the mass data-scraping system that his company has built and believes that it\u2019s key to fighting criminal activities such as human trafficking. The company even says its application could be useful for finding out more about a person they\u2019ve just met, such as through dating or business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere are other facial recognition patents out there \u2014 that are methods of doing it \u2014 but this is the first one around the use of large-scale internet data,\u201d Ton-That told Politico in an interview.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rights groups have criticised the seemingly imminent decision to grant Clearview AI a patent as essentially patenting a violation of human rights law.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Photo by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@etiennegirardet?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Etienne Girardet<\/a>\u00a0on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"220\" height=\"124\" src=\"http:\/\/artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/9\/2021\/12\/ai-expo-north-america.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11454\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ai-expo-north-america.jpg 220w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ai-expo-north-america-100x56.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.artificialintelligence-news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ai-expo-north-america-60x34.jpg 60w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?<\/strong> Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ai-expo.net\/northamerica\/\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo North America<\/a> on 11-12 May 2022.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Clearview AI is reportedly just a bank transfer away from receiving a US patent for its controversial facial recognition technology.
