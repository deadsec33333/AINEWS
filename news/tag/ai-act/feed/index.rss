<p>AI News caught up with Nerijus Šveistys, Senior Legal Counsel at <a href="https://oxylabs.io/">Oxylabs</a>, to understand the state of play when it comes to AI regulation and its potential implications for industries, businesses, and innovation.</p>



<p>“The boom of the last few years appears to have sparked a push to establish regulatory frameworks for AI governance,” explains Šveistys.</p>



<p>“This is a natural development, as the rise of AI seems to pose issues in data privacy and protection, bias and discrimination, safety, intellectual property, and other legal areas, as well as ethics that need to be addressed.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Regions diverge in regulatory strategy</h3>



<p>The European Union’s <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/eu-ai-act-early-prep-could-give-businesses-competitive-edge/">AI Act</a> has, unsurprisingly, positioned the region with a strict, centralised approach. The regulation, which came into force this year, is set to be fully effective by 2026.</p>



<p>Šveistys pointed out that the EU has acted relatively swiftly compared to other jurisdictions: “The main difference we can see is the comparative quickness with which the EU has released a uniform regulation to govern the use of all types of AI.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, other regions have opted for more piecemeal approaches. China, for instance, has been implementing regulations specific to certain AI technologies in a phased-out manner. According to Šveistys, China began regulating AI models as early as 2021.</p>



<p>“In 2021, they introduced regulation on recommendation algorithms, which [had] increased their capabilities in digital advertising. It was followed by regulations <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/chinas-deepfake-laws-come-into-effect-today/">on deep synthesis models</a> or, in common terms, deepfakes and content generation in 2022,” he said.</p>



<p>“Then, in 2023, regulation on generative AI models was introduced as these models were making a splash in commercial usage.”</p>



<p>The US, in contrast, remains relatively uncoordinated in its approach. Federal-level regulations are yet to be enacted, with efforts mostly emerging at the state level.</p>



<p>“There are proposed regulations at the state level, such as the so-called California AI Act, but even if they come into power, it may still take some time before they do,” Šveistys noted.</p>



<p>This delay in implementing unified AI regulations in the US has raised questions about the extent to which business pushback may be contributing to the slow rollout. Šveistys said that while lobbyist pressure is a known factor, it’s not the only potential reason.</p>



<p>“There was <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/tech-industry-giants-urge-eu-streamline-ai-regulations/">pushback to the EU AI Act</a>, too, which was nevertheless introduced. Thus, it is not clear whether the delay in the US is only due to lobbyism or other obstacles in the legislation enactment process,” explains Šveistys.</p>



<p>“It might also be because some still see AI as a futuristic concern, not fully appreciating the extent to which it is already a legal issue of today.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Balancing innovation and safety</h3>



<p>Differentiated regulatory approaches could affect the pace of innovation and business competitiveness across regions.</p>



<p>Europe’s regulatory framework, though more stringent, aims to ensure consumer protection and ethical adherence—something that less-regulated environments may lack.</p>



<p>“More rigid regulatory frameworks may impose compliance costs for businesses in the AI field and stifle competitiveness and innovation. On the other hand, they bring the benefits of protecting consumers and adhering to certain ethical norms,” comments Šveistys.</p>



<p>This trade-off is especially pronounced in AI-related sectors such as targeted advertising, where algorithmic bias is increasingly scrutinised.</p>



<p>AI governance often extends beyond laws that specifically target AI, incorporating related legal areas like those governing data collection and privacy. For example, the EU AI Act also regulates the use of AI in physical devices, such as elevators.</p>



<p>&#8220;Additionally, all businesses that collect data for advertisement are potentially affected as AI regulation can also cover algorithmic bias in targeted advertising,&#8221; emphasises Šveistys.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Impact on related industries</h3>



<p>One industry that is deeply intertwined with AI developments is web scraping. Typically used for collecting publicly available data, web scraping is undergoing an AI-driven evolution.</p>



<p>&#8220;From data collection, validation, analysis, or overcoming anti-scraping measures, there is a lot of potential for AI to massively improve the efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability of web scraping operations,&#8221; said Šveistys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as AI regulation and related laws tighten, web scraping companies will face greater scrutiny.</p>



<p>“AI regulations may also bring the spotlight on certain areas of law that were always very relevant to the web scraping industry, such as privacy or copyright laws,” Šveistys added.</p>



<p>“At the end of the day, scraping content protected by such laws without proper authorisation could always lead to legal issues, and now so can using AI this way.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Copyright battles and legal precedents</h3>



<p>The implications of AI regulation are also playing out on a broader legal stage, particularly in cases involving generative AI tools.</p>



<p>High-profile <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/openai-and-microsoft-lawsuit-github-copilot/">lawsuits</a> have been launched against AI giants like OpenAI and its primary backer, Microsoft, by authors, artists, and musicians who claim their copyrighted materials were used to train AI systems without proper permission.</p>



<p>“These cases are pivotal in determining the legal boundaries of using copyrighted material for AI development and establishing legal precedents for protecting intellectual property in the digital age,” said Šveistys.</p>



<p>While these lawsuits could take years to resolve, their outcomes may fundamentally shape the future of AI development. So, what can businesses do now as the regulatory and legal landscape continues to evolve?</p>



<p>“Speaking about the specific cases of using copyrighted material for AI training, businesses should approach this the same way as any web-scraping activity – that is, evaluate the specific data they wish to collect with the help of a legal expert in the field,” recommends Šveistys.</p>



<p>“It is important to recognise that the AI legal landscape is very new and rapidly evolving, with not many precedents in place to refer to as of yet. Hence, continuous monitoring and adaptation of your AI usage are crucial.”</p>



<p>Just this week, the UK Government made headlines with its announcement of a consultation on the use of copyrighted material for training AI models. Under the proposals, tech firms could be permitted to use copyrighted material unless owners have specifically opted out.</p>



<p>Despite the diversity of approaches globally, the AI regulatory push marks a significant moment for technological governance. Whether through the EU’s comprehensive model, China’s step-by-step strategy, or narrower, state-level initiatives like in the US, businesses worldwide must navigate a complex, evolving framework.</p>



<p>The challenge ahead will be striking the right balance between fostering innovation and mitigating risks, ensuring that AI remains a force for good while avoiding potential harms.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/first-draft-general-purpose-ai-code-practice-published-written-independent-experts">release</a> of the &#8220;First Draft General-Purpose AI Code of Practice&#8221; marks the EU&#8217;s effort to create comprehensive regulatory guidance for general-purpose AI models.</p>



<p>The development of this draft has been a collaborative effort, involving input from diverse sectors including industry, academia, and civil society. The initiative was led by four specialised Working Groups, each addressing specific aspects of AI governance and risk mitigation:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Working Group 1: Transparency and copyright-related rules</li>



<li>Working Group 2: Risk identification and assessment for systemic risk</li>



<li>Working Group 3: Technical risk mitigation for systemic risk</li>



<li>Working Group 4: Governance risk mitigation for systemic risk</li>
</ul>



<p>The draft is aligned with existing laws such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It takes into account international approaches, striving for proportionality to risks, and aims to be future-proof by contemplating rapid technological changes.</p>



<p>Key objectives outlined in the draft include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Clarifying compliance methods for providers of general-purpose AI models</li>



<li>Facilitating understanding across the AI value chain, ensuring seamless integration of AI models into downstream products</li>



<li>Ensuring compliance with Union law on copyrights, especially concerning the use of copyrighted material for model training</li>



<li>Continuously assessing and mitigating systemic risks associated with AI models</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Recognising and mitigating systemic risks</h3>



<p>A core feature of the draft is its taxonomy of systemic risks, which includes types, natures, and sources of such risks. The document outlines various threats such as cyber offences, biological risks, loss of control over autonomous AI models, and large-scale disinformation. By acknowledging the continuously evolving nature of AI technology, the draft recognises that this taxonomy will need updates to remain relevant.</p>



<p>As AI models with systemic risks become more common, the draft emphasises the need for robust safety and security frameworks (SSFs). It proposes a hierarchy of measures, sub-measures, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to ensure appropriate risk identification, analysis, and mitigation throughout a model&#8217;s lifecycle.</p>



<p>The draft suggests that providers establish processes to identify and report serious incidents associated with their AI models, offering detailed assessments and corrections as needed. It also encourages collaboration with independent experts for risk assessment, especially for models posing significant systemic risks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Taking a proactive stance to AI regulatory guidance</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/eu-ai-act-early-prep-could-give-businesses-competitive-edge/">EU AI Act</a>, which came into force on 1 August 2024, mandates that the final version of this Code be ready by 1 May 2025. This initiative underscores the EU&#8217;s proactive stance towards AI regulation, emphasising the need for AI safety, transparency, and accountability.</p>



<p>As the draft continues to evolve, the working groups invite stakeholders to participate actively in refining the document. Their collaborative input will shape a regulatory framework aimed at safeguarding innovation while protecting society from the potential pitfalls of AI technology.</p>



<p>While still in draft form, the EU&#8217;s Code of Practice for general-purpose AI models could set a benchmark for responsible AI development and deployment globally. By addressing key issues such as transparency, risk management, and copyright compliance, the Code aims to create a regulatory environment that fosters innovation, upholds fundamental rights, and ensures a high level of consumer protection.</p>



<p><em>This draft is open for written feedback until 28 November 2024.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The EU AI Act is set to fully take effect in August 2026, but some provisions are coming into force even earlier.</p>



<p>The legislation establishes a first-of-its-kind regulatory framework for AI systems, employing a risk-based approach that categorises AI applications based on their potential impact on safety, human rights, and societal wellbeing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Some systems are banned entirely, while systems deemed &#8216;high-risk&#8217; are subject to stricter requirements and assessments before deployment,&#8221; explains the <a href="https://www.dpocentre.com/">DPO Centre</a>, a data protection consultancy.</p>



<p>Similar to <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr.html">GDPR</a>, the Act&#8217;s extra-territorial reach means it applies to any organisation marketing, deploying, or using AI systems within the EU, regardless of where the system is developed. Businesses will be classified primarily as either ‘Providers’ or ‘Deployers,’ with additional categories for ‘Distributors,’ ‘Importers,’ ‘Product Manufacturers,’ and ‘Authorised Representatives.’</p>



<p>For organisations developing or deploying AI systems, particularly those classified as high-risk, compliance preparation promises to be complex. However, experts suggest viewing this as an opportunity rather than a burden.</p>



<p>&#8220;By embracing compliance as a catalyst for more transparent AI usage, businesses can turn regulatory demands into a competitive advantage,&#8221; notes the DPO Centre.</p>



<p>Key preparation strategies include comprehensive staff training, establishing robust corporate governance, and implementing strong cybersecurity measures. The legislation&#8217;s requirements often overlap with existing GDPR frameworks, particularly regarding transparency and accountability.</p>



<p>Organisations must also adhere to ethical AI principles and maintain clear documentation of their systems&#8217; functionality, limitations, and intended use. The EU is currently developing specific codes of practice and templates to assist with compliance obligations.</p>



<p>For businesses uncertain about their obligations, experts recommend seeking professional guidance early. Tools like the EU AI Act Compliance Checker can help organisations verify their systems&#8217; alignment with regulatory requirements.</p>



<p>Rather than viewing compliance as <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/tech-industry-giants-urge-eu-streamline-ai-regulations/">merely a regulatory burden</a>, forward-thinking organisations should view the EU’s AI Act <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/balancing-innovation-trust-experts-assess-eu-ai-act/">as an opportunity</a> to demonstrate commitment to responsible AI development and build greater trust with their customers.</p>

<p>As the EU&#8217;s AI Act prepares to come into force tomorrow, industry experts are weighing in on its potential impact, highlighting its role in building trust and encouraging responsible AI adoption.</p>



<p>Curtis Wilson, Staff Data Engineer at Synopsys’ <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/all-products-services.html">Software Integrity Group</a>, believes the new regulation could be a crucial step in addressing the AI industry&#8217;s most pressing challenge: building trust.</p>



<p>&#8220;The greatest problem facing AI developers is not regulation, but a lack of trust in AI,&#8221; Wilson stated. &#8220;For an AI system to reach its full potential, it needs to be trusted by the people who use it.&#8221;</p>



<p>This sentiment is echoed by Paul Cardno, Global Digital Automation &amp; Innovation Senior Manager at <a href="https://www.3m.co.uk/">3M</a>, who noted, &#8220;With nearly 80% of UK adults now believing AI needs to be heavily regulated, the introduction of the EU&#8217;s AI Act is something that businesses have been long-waiting for.&#8221;</p>



<p>Both experts emphasise the Act&#8217;s potential to foster confidence in AI technologies. Wilson explained that while his company has implemented internal measures to build trust, external regulation is equally important.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act as an essential component to building trust in AI,&#8221; Wilson said. &#8220;The strict rules and punishing fines will deter careless developers and help customers feel more confident in trusting and using AI systems.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cardno added, &#8220;We know that AI is shaping the future, but companies will only be able to reap the rewards if they have the confidence to rethink existing processes and break away from entrenched structures.&#8221;</p>



<p>The EU AI Act primarily focuses on high-risk systems and foundational models. Wilson noted that many of its requirements align with existing best practices in data science, such as risk management, testing procedures, and comprehensive documentation.</p>



<p>For UK businesses, the impact of the EU AI Act extends beyond those directly selling to EU markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wilson pointed out that certain aspects of the Act may apply to Northern Ireland due to the Windsor Framework. Additionally, the UK government is developing its own AI regulations, with a recent whitepaper emphasising interoperability with EU and US regulations.</p>



<p>&#8220;While the EU Act isn&#8217;t perfect, and needs to be assessed in relation to other global regulations, having a clear framework and guidance on AI from one of the world&#8217;s major economies will help encourage those who remain on the fence to tap into the AI revolution,&#8221; Cardno explained.</p>



<p>While acknowledging that the new regulations may create some friction, particularly around registration and certification, Wilson emphasised that many of the Act&#8217;s obligations are already standard practice for responsible companies. However, he recognised that small companies and startups might face greater challenges.</p>



<p>&#8220;Small companies and start-ups will experience issues more strongly,&#8221; Wilson said. &#8220;The regulation acknowledges this and has included provisions for sandboxes to foster AI innovation for these smaller businesses.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, Wilson notes that these sandboxes will be established at the national level by individual EU member states, potentially limiting access for UK businesses.</p>



<p>As the AI landscape continues to evolve, the EU AI Act represents a significant step towards establishing a framework for responsible AI development and deployment.</p>



<p>&#8220;Having a clear framework and guidance on AI from one of the world&#8217;s major economies will help encourage those who remain on the fence to tap into the AI revolution, ensuring it has a safe, positive ongoing influence for all organisations operating across the EU, which can only be a promising step forwards for the industry,&#8221; concludes Cardno.</p>

<p><a href="https://about.meta.com/%20meta/">Meta</a> has announced it will not be launching its upcoming multimodal AI model in the European Union due to regulatory concerns.</p>



<p>This decision from Meta comes on the heels of Apple&#8217;s similar move <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/apple-eu-ai-delay-innovation-vs-regulation/">to exclude the EU</a> from its Apple Intelligence rollout, signalling a growing trend of tech giants hesitating to introduce advanced AI technologies in the region.</p>



<p>Meta’s latest multimodal AI model – capable of handling video, audio, images, and text – was set to be released under an open license. However, Meta&#8217;s decision will prevent European companies from utilising this technology, potentially putting them at a disadvantage in the global AI race.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will release a multimodal Llama model over the coming months, but not in the EU due to the unpredictable nature of the European regulatory environment,&#8221; a Meta spokesperson stated.</p>



<p>A text-only version of Meta&#8217;s Llama 3 model is still expected to launch in the EU.</p>



<p>Meta’s announcement comes just days after the EU finalised compliance deadlines for its new <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/eu-launches-office-implement-ai-act-foster-innovation/">AI Act</a>. Tech companies operating in the EU will have until August 2026 to comply with rules surrounding copyright, transparency, and specific AI applications like predictive policing.</p>



<p>The withholding of these advanced AI models from the EU market creates a challenging situation for companies outside the region. Those hoping to provide products and services utilising these models will be unable to offer them in one of the world&#8217;s largest economic markets.</p>



<p>Meta plans to integrate its multimodal AI models into products like the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses. The company&#8217;s EU exclusion will extend to future multimodal AI model releases as well.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Meta will *not* release the multimodal versions of its AI products and models in the EU because of an unpredictable regulatory environment. <br>This means that EU users of Ray-Ban Meta won&#39;t be able to use the image understanding features.<br>It also means that the EU industry will not…</p>&mdash; Yann LeCun (@ylecun) <a href="https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1814308324038381618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>As more tech giants potentially follow suit, the EU may face challenges in maintaining its position as a leader in technological innovation while balancing concerns about AI&#8217;s societal impacts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Union has launched a new office dedicated to overseeing the implementation of its landmark <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/2024/03/13/eu-approves-controversial-ai-act-mixed-reactions/">AI Act</a>, which is regarded as one of the most comprehensive AI regulations in the world. This new initiative adopts a risk-based approach, imposing stringent regulations on higher-risk AI applications to ensure their safe and ethical deployment.</p>



<p>The primary goal of this office is to promote the &#8220;future development, deployment and use&#8221; of AI technologies, aiming to harness their societal and economic benefits while mitigating associated risks. By focusing on innovation and safety, the office seeks to position the EU as a global leader in AI regulation and development.</p>



<p>According to Margerthe Vertager, the EU competition chief, the new office will play a &#8220;key role&#8221; in implementing the AI Act, particularly with regard to general-purpose AI models. She stated, &#8220;Together with developers and a scientific community, the office will evaluate and test general-purpose AI to ensure that AI serves us as humans and upholds our European values.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sridhar Iyengar, Managing Director for <a href="https://www.zoho.com/">Zoho Europe</a>, welcomed the establishment of the AI office, noting, &#8220;The establishment of the AI office in the European Commission to play a key role with the implementation of the EU AI Act is a welcome sign of progress, and it is encouraging to see the EU positioning itself as a global leader in AI regulation. We hope to continue to see collaboration between governments, businesses, academics and industry experts to guide on safe use of AI to boost business growth.&#8221;</p>



<p>Iyengar highlighted the dual nature of AI&#8217;s impact on businesses, pointing out both its benefits and concerns. He emphasised the importance of adhering to best practice guidance and legislative guardrails to ensure safe and ethical AI adoption.</p>



<p>&#8220;AI can drive innovation in business tools, helping to improve fraud detection, forecasting, and customer data analysis to name a few. These benefits not only have the potential to elevate customer experience but can increase efficiency, present insights, and suggest actions to drive further success,&#8221; Iyengar said.</p>



<p>The office will be staffed by more than 140 individuals, including technology specialists, administrative assistants, lawyers, policy specialists, and economists. It will consist of various units focusing on regulation and compliance, as well as safety and innovation, reflecting the multifaceted approach needed to govern AI effectively.</p>



<p>Rachael Hays, Transformation Director for <a href="https://www.definia.com/">Definia</a>, part of The IN Group, commented: &#8220;The establishment of a dedicated AI Office within the European Commission underscores the EU&#8217;s commitment to both innovation and regulation which is undoubtedly crucial in this rapidly evolving AI landscape.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hays also pointed out the potential for workforce upskilling that this initiative provides. She referenced findings from their Tech and the Boardroom research, which revealed that over half of boardroom leaders view AI as the biggest direct threat to their organisations.</p>



<p>&#8220;This initiative directly addresses these fears as employees across various sectors are given the opportunity to adapt and thrive in an AI-driven world. The AI Office offers promising hope and guidance in developing economic benefits while mitigating risks associated with AI technology, something we should all get on board with,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>As the EU takes these steps towards comprehensive AI governance, the office’s work will be pivotal in driving forward both innovation and safety in the field.</p>

<p>The European Parliament today <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240308IPR19015/artificial-intelligence-act-meps-adopt-landmark-law">approved</a> the AI Act, the first ever regulatory framework governing the use of AI systems. The legislation passed with an overwhelming majority of 523 votes in favour, 46 against and 49 abstentions.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a historic day,&#8221; said Italian lawmaker Brando Benifei, co-lead on the AI Act. &#8220;We have the first regulation in the world which puts a clear path for safe and human-centric development of AI.&#8221;</p>



<p>The AI Act will categorise AI systems into four tiers based on their potential risk to society. High-risk applications like self-driving cars will face strict requirements before being allowed on the EU market. Lower risk systems will have fewer obligations.</p>



<p>&#8220;The main point now will be implementation and compliance by businesses and institutions,&#8221; Benifei stated. &#8220;We are also working on further AI legislation for workplace conditions.&#8221;</p>



<p>His counterpart, Dragoş Tudorache of Romania, said the EU aims to promote these pioneering rules globally. &#8220;We have to be open to work with others on how to build governance with like-minded parties.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨BREAKING: The European Parliament has just APPROVED the AI Act. What everyone should know:<br><br>➵ The AI Act follows a risk-based approach. Some AI systems are banned, such as those involving:<br><br>&#8211; Cognitive behavioral manipulation of people or specific vulnerable groups;<br>&#8211; Social… <a href="https://t.co/JiaA8qXEGx">pic.twitter.com/JiaA8qXEGx</a></p>&mdash; Luiza Jarovsky (@LuizaJarovsky) <a href="https://twitter.com/LuizaJarovsky/status/1767899302930657704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 13, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The general AI rules take effect in May 2025, while obligations for high-risk systems kick in after three years. National oversight agencies will monitor compliance.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Differing viewpoints on impact</h4>



<p>Reaction was mixed on whether the Act properly balances innovation with protecting rights.</p>



<p>Curtis Wilson, a data scientist at <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/">Synopsys</a>, believes it will build public trust: &#8220;The strict rules and punishing fines will deter careless developers, and help customers be more confident in using AI systems&#8230;Ensuring all AI developers adhere to these standards is to everyone&#8217;s benefit.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, Mher Hakobyan from Amnesty International criticised the legislation as favouring industry over human rights: &#8220;It is disappointing that the EU chose to prioritise interests of industry and law enforcement over protecting people&#8230;It lacks proper transparency and accountability provisions, which will likely exacerbate abuses.&#8221;</p>



<p>Companies now face the challenge of overhauling practices to comply.</p>



<p>Marcus Evans, a data privacy lawyer, advised: &#8220;Businesses need to create and maintain robust AI governance to make the best use of the technology and ensure compliance with the new regime&#8230;They need to start preparing now to not fall foul of the rules.&#8221;</p>



<p>After years of negotiations, the AI Act signals the EU intends to lead globally on this transformative technology. But dissenting voices show challenges remain in finding the right balance.</p>

<p><strong>Europe is tinkering with legislation to regulate artificial intelligence. European regulators are delighted with this, but what does the world say about the AI Act?</strong></p>



<p>Now&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techzine.eu/blogs/analytics/107499/eu-votes-on-ai-act-draft-should-chatgpt-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the outlines for the AI Act</a>&nbsp;are known, a debate is beginning to erupt around its possible implications. One camp believes regulations are needed to curb the risks of powerful AI technology, while the other is convinced that regulation will prove pernicious for the European economy. Is it out of the question that safe AI products also bring economic prosperity?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-industrial-revolution-without-europe">‘Industrial revolution’ without Europe</h3>



<p>The EU “prevents the industrial revolution from happening” and portrays itself as “no part of the future world,” Joe Lonsdale told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-15/europe-risks-suicide-with-ai-regulation-texas-vc-warns?srnd=technology-vp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="">Bloomberg</a>. He regularly appears in the US media around AI topics as an outspoken advocate of the technology. According to him, the technology has the potential to cause a third industrial revolution, and every company should already have implemented it in its organization.</p>



<p>He earned a bachelor’s degree in computer science in 2003. Meanwhile, he co-founded several technology companies, including those that deploy artificial intelligence. He later grew to become a businessman and venture capitalist.</p>



<p>The only question is, are the concerns well-founded? At the very least, caution seems necessary to avoid seeing major AI products disappear from Europe. Sam Altman, a better-known IT figure as CEO of OpenAI, previously spoke out about the possible disappearance of AI companies from Europe if the rules become too hard to apply. He does not plan to pull ChatGPT out of Europe because of the AI law, but he warns here of the possible actions of other companies.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-stays">ChatGPT stays</h3>



<p>The CEO himself is essentially a strong supporter of security legislation for AI. He&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techzine.eu/news/privacy-compliance/106180/openai-ceo-calls-for-new-security-legislation-for-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advocates for clear security requirements</a>&nbsp;that AI developers must meet before the official release of a new product.</p>



<p>When a major player in the AI field calls for regulation of the technology he is working with, perhaps we as Europe should listen. That is what is happening with the AI Act, through which the EU is trying to be the first in the world to put out a set of rules for artificial intelligence. The EU is a pioneer, but it will also have to discover the pitfalls of a policy in the absence of a working example in the world.</p>



<p>The rules will be continuously tested until they officially come into effect in 2025 by experts who publicly give their opinions on the law. A public testing period which AI developers should also find important, Altman said. The European Union also avoids making up rules from higher up for a field it doesn’t know much about itself. The legislation will come bottom-up by involving companies and developers already actively engaged in AI setting the standards.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-copy-off">Copy off</h3>



<p>Although the EU often pronounces that the AI law will be the world’s first regulation of artificial intelligence, other places are tinkering with a legal framework just as much. The United Kingdom, for example, is eager to embrace the technology but also wants certainty about its security. To that end, it immerses itself in the technology and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techzine.eu/news/applications/107364/british-pm-kicks-off-london-tech-week-with-ai-safety-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gains early access&nbsp;</a>to DeepMind, OpenAI and Anthropic’s models for research purposes.</p>



<p>However, Britain has no plans to punish companies that do not comply. The country limits itself to a framework of five principles that artificial intelligence should comply with. The choice seems to play to the disadvantage of guaranteed safety of AI products, as the country says it is necessary not to make a mandatory political framework for companies, to attract investment from AI companies in the UK. So secure AI products and economic prosperity do not appear to fit well together according to the country. Wait and see if Europe’s AI law validates that.</p>

<p>In this article, the writers compare the United Kingdom’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach">plans</a> for implementing a pro-innovation approach to regulation (“UK Approach”) versus the European Union’s proposed Artificial Intelligence Act (the “EU AI Act”).</p>



<p><strong>Authors</strong>: Sean Musch, AI &amp; Partners and Michael Borrelli, AI &amp; Partners</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI – The opportunity and the challenge</strong></h4>



<p>AI currently delivers broad societal benefits, from medical advances to mitigating climate change. As an example, an AI technology developed by DeepMind, a UK- based business, can predict the structure of almost every protein known to science. Government frameworks consider the role of regulation in creating the environment for AI to flourish. AI technologies have not yet reached their full potential. Under the right conditions, AI will transform all areas of life and stimulate economies by unleashing innovation and driving productivity, creating new jobs and improving the workplace.</p>



<p>The UK has indicated a requirement to act quickly to continue to lead the international conversation on AI governance and demonstrate the value of our pragmatic, proportionate regulatory approach. In their report, the UK government identify the short time frame for intervention to provide a clear, pro-innovation regulatory environment in order to make the UK one of the top places in the world to build foundational AI companies. Not too dissimilar to this EU legislators have signalled an intention to make the EU a global hub for AI innovation. On both fronts responding to risk and building public trust are important drivers for regulation. Yet, clear and consistent regulation can also support business investment and build confidence in innovation.</p>



<p>What remains critical for the industry is winning and retaining consumer trust, which is key to the success of innovation economies. Neither the EU nor the UK can afford not to have clear, proportionate approaches to regulation that enable the responsible application of  AI to flourish. Without such consideration, they risk creating cumbersome rules applying to all AI technologies.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the policy objectives and intended effects?</strong></h4>



<p>Similarities exist in terms of the overall aims. As shown in the table below, the core similarities revolve around growth, safety and economic prosperity:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left"><strong>EU AI Act</strong></td><td><strong>UK Approach</strong></td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left">Ensure that AI systems placed on the market and used are <strong>safe </strong>and respect existing laws on <strong>fundamental rights</strong> and Union<strong> values</strong>.</td><td>Drive <strong>growth</strong> and <strong>prosperity</strong> by boosting innovation, investment, and public trust to harness the opportunities and benefits that AI technologies present.</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left">Enhance <strong>governance</strong> and effective <strong>enforcement</strong> of existing laws on fundamental rights and safety requirements applicable to AI systems.</td><td>Strengthen the UK’s position as a <strong>global leader</strong> in AI, by ensuring the UK is the best place to develop and use AI technologies.</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left">Ensure legal certainty to facilitate <strong>investment</strong> and <strong>innovation</strong> in AI.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left">Facilitate the development of a single market for <strong>lawful</strong>, <strong>safe</strong>, and <strong>trustworthy</strong> AI applications and prevent market fragmentation.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the problems being tackled?</strong></h4>



<p>Again, similarities exist in terms of a common focus: the end-user. AI’s involvement in multiple activities of the economy, whether this be from simple chatbots to biometric identification, inevitably mean that end-users end up being affected. Protecting them at all costs seems to be the presiding theme:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>EU AI Act</strong></td><td><strong>UK Approach</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Safety risks.</strong> Increased risks to the safety and security of citizens caused by the use of AI systems.</td><td><strong>Market failures</strong>. A number of market failures (information asymmetry, misaligned incentives, negative externalities, regulatory failure), mean AI risks are not being adequately addressed.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fundamental rights risk</strong>. The use of AI systems poses an increased risk of violations of citizens’ fundamental rights and Union values.</td><td><strong>Consumer risks</strong>. These risks include damage to physical and mental health, bias and discrimination, and infringements on privacy and individual rights.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Legal uncertainty</strong>. Legal uncertainty and complexity on how to ensure compliance with rules applicable to AI systems dissuade businesses from developing and using the technology.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Enforcement</strong>. Competent authorities do not have the powers and/or procedural framework to ensure compliance of AIuse with fundamental rights and safety.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mistrust</strong>.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the differences in policy options?</strong></h4>



<p>A variety of options have been considered by the respective policymakers. On the face of it, pro-innovation requires a holistic examination to account for the variety of challenges new ways of working generate. The EU sets the standard with Option 3:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left"><strong>EU AI Act (Decided)</strong></td><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left"><strong>UK Approach (In Process)</strong></td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left"><strong>Option 1</strong> – EU Voluntary labelling scheme &#8211; An EU act establishing a voluntary labelling scheme.

One horizontal AI definition, but no methodology/gradation (all risks covered).</td><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left"><strong>&#8211;</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the estimated direct compliance costs to firms?</strong></h4>



<p>Both the UK Approach and the EU AI Act regulatory framework will apply to all AI systems being designed or developed, made available or otherwise being used in the EU/UK, whether they are developed in the EU/UK or abroad. Both businesses that develop and deploy AI, “AI businesses”, and businesses that use AI, “AI adopting businesses”, are in the scope of the framework. These two types of firms have different expected costs per business under the respective frameworks.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>UK Approach: Key assumptions for AI system costs</strong></h5>



<p><strong>Key finding</strong>: Cost of compliance for HRS highest under Option 3</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Option</strong></td><td><strong>Option 0</strong></td><td><strong>Option 1</strong></td><td><strong>Option 2</strong></td><td><strong>Option 3</strong></td></tr><tr><td>% of businesses that provide high-risk systems (HRS)</td><td>&#8211;</td><td>8.1%</td><td>8.1%</td><td>8.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of compliance per HRS</td><td>&#8211;</td><td>£3,698</td><td>£3,698</td><td>£36,981</td></tr><tr><td>% of businesses that AI systems that interact with natural persons (non-HRS)</td><td>&#8211;</td><td>39.0%</td><td>39.0%</td><td>39.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of compliance per non-HRS</td><td>&#8211;</td><td>£330</td><td>£330</td><td>£330</td></tr><tr><td>Assumed number of AI systems per AI business (2020)</td><td>&#8211;</td><td colspan="3"><strong>Small </strong>– 2<br><strong>Medium </strong>– 5<br><strong>Large </strong>&#8211; 10</td></tr><tr><td>Assumed number of AI systems per AI-adopting business (2020)</td><td>&#8211;</td><td colspan="3"><strong>Small </strong>– 2<br><strong>Medium </strong>– 5<br><strong>Large </strong>&#8211; 10</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>EU AI Act: Total compliance cost of the five requirements for each AI product</strong></h5>



<p><strong>Key finding</strong>: Information provision represents the highest cost incurred by firms.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Administrative Activity</strong></td><td><strong>Total Minutes</strong></td><td><strong>Total Admin Cost (Hourly rate = €32)</strong></td><td><strong>Total Cost</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Training Data</td><td>€5,180.5</td><td>&#8211;</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>Documents &amp; Record Keeping</td><td>€2,231</td><td>&#8211;</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>Information Provision</td><td>€6,800</td><td>&#8211;</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>Human Oversight</td><td>€1,260</td><td>&#8211;</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>Robustness and Accuracy</td><td>€4,750</td><td>&#8211;</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>€20,581.5</strong></td><td><strong>€10,976.8</strong></td><td><strong>€29,276.8</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>In light of these comparisons, it appears the EU estimates a lower cost of compliance compared to the UK. Lower costs don’t confer a less rigid approach. Rather, they indicate an itemised approach to cost estimation as well as using a standard pricing metric, hours. In practice, firms are likely to aim to make this more efficient by reducing the number of hours required to achieve compliance.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lessons from the UK Approach for the EU AI Act</strong></h4>



<p>The forthcoming EU AI Act is set to place the EU at the global forefront of regulating this emerging technology. Accordingly, models for the governance and mitigation of AI risk from outside the region can still provide insightful lessons for EU decision-makers to learn and issues to account for before the EU AI Act is passed.</p>



<p>This is certainly applicable to Article 9 of the EU AI Act, which requires <strong>developers </strong>to establish, implement, document, and maintain risk management systems for high-risk AI systems. There are three key ideas for EU decision-makers to consider from the UK Approach.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI assurance techniques and technical standards</strong></h5>



<p>Unlike Article 17 of the EU AI Act, the quality management system put in place by providers of high-risk AI systems is designed to ensure compliance. To do this, providers of high-risk  AI  systems must establish techniques, procedures, and systematic actions to be used for development, quality control, and quality assurance. The EU AI Act only briefly covers the concept of assurance, but it could benefit from publishing assurance techniques and technical standards that play a critical role in enabling the responsible adoption of AI so that potential harms at all levels of society are identified and documented.</p>



<p>To assure AI systems effectively, the UK government is calling for a toolbox of assurance techniques to measure, evaluate, and communicate the trustworthiness of AI systems across the development and deployment life cycle. These techniques include impact assessment, audit, and performance testing along with formal verification methods. To help innovators understand how AI assurance techniques can support wider AI governance, the government launched a <a href="https://cdei.blog.gov.uk/2023/06/07/from-principles-to-practice-launching-the-portfolio-of-ai-assurance-techniques/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8216;Portfolio of AI Assurance techniques&#8217;</a> in Spring 2023. This is an industry collaboration to showcase how these tools are already being applied by businesses to real-world use cases and how they align with the AI regulatory principles.</p>



<p>Similarly, assurance techniques need to be underpinned by available technical standards, which provide a common understanding across assurance providers. Technical standards and assurance techniques will also enable organisations to demonstrate that their systems are in line with the regulatory principles enshrined under the EU AI Act and the UK Approach. Similarities exist in terms of the stage of development.</p>



<p>Specifically, the EU AI Act defines common mandatory requirements applicable to the design and development of certain AI systems before they are placed on the market that will be further operationalised through harmonised technical standards. In equal fashion, the UK government intends to have a leading role in the development of international technical standards, working with industry, international and UK partners. The UK government plans to continue to support the role of technical standards in complementing our approach to AI regulation, including through the UK AI Standards Hub. These technical standards may demonstrate firms’ compliance with the EU AI Act.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A harmonised vocabulary</strong></h5>



<p>All relevant parties would benefit from reaching a consensus on the definitions of key terms related to the foundations of AI regulation. While the EU AI Act and the UK Approach are either under development or in the incubation stage, decision-makers for both initiatives should seize the opportunity to develop a shared understanding of core AI ideas, principles, and concepts, and codify these into a harmonised transatlantic vocabulary. As shown below, identification of where both initiatives are in agreement, and where they diverge, has been undertaken:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center"><strong>EU AI Act</strong></td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center"><strong>UK Approach</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shared</strong></td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center" colspan="2">Accountability<br>Safety<br>Privacy<br>Transparency<br>Fairness</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Divergent</strong></td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Data Governance<br>Diversity<br>Environmental and Social Well-Being<br>Human Agency and Oversight<br>Technical Robustness<br>Non-Discrimination</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Governance<br>Security<br>Robustness<br>Explainability<br>Contestability<br>Redress</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>As the EU debates the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52021PC0206">AI Act</a>, lessons from open-source software can inform the regulatory approach to open ML systems.</p>



<p>The AI Act, set to be a global precedent, aims to address the risks associated with AI while encouraging the development of cutting-edge technology. One of the key aspects of this Act is its support for open-source, non-profit, and academic research and development in the AI ecosystem. Such support ensures the development of safe, transparent, and accountable AI systems that benefit all EU citizens.</p>



<p>Drawing from the success of open-source software development, policymakers can craft regulations that encourage open AI development while safeguarding user interests. By providing exemptions and proportional requirements for open ML systems, the EU can foster innovation and competition in the AI market while maintaining a thriving open-source ecosystem.</p>



<p>Representing both commercial and nonprofit stakeholders, several organisations – including GitHub, Hugging Face, EleutherAI, Creative Commons, and more – have banded together to release a policy paper calling on EU policymakers to protect open-source innovation.</p>



<p>The organisations have five proposals:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Define AI components clearly:</strong> Clear definitions of AI components will help stakeholders understand their roles and responsibilities, facilitating collaboration and innovation in the open ecosystem.</li>
</ol>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="2">
<li><strong>Clarify that collaborative development of open-source AI components is exempt from AI Act requirements:</strong> To encourage open-source development, the Act should clarify that contributors to public repositories are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as commercial entities.</li>
</ol>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="3">
<li><strong>Support the AI Office&#8217;s coordination with the open-source ecosystem:</strong> The Act should encourage inclusive governance and collaboration between the AI Office and open-source developers to foster transparency and knowledge exchange.</li>
</ol>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="4">
<li><strong>Ensure practical and effective R&amp;D exception:</strong> Allow limited real-world testing in different conditions, combining aspects of the Council&#8217;s approach and the Parliament&#8217;s Article 2(5d), to facilitate research and development without compromising safety and accountability.</li>
</ol>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="5">
<li><strong>Set proportional requirements for &#8220;foundation models&#8221;:</strong> Differentiate between various uses and development modalities of foundation models, including open source approaches, to ensure fair treatment and promote competition.</li>
</ol>



<p>Open-source AI development offers several advantages, including transparency, inclusivity, and modularity. It allows stakeholders to collaborate and build on each other&#8217;s work, leading to more robust and diverse AI models. For instance, the <a href="https://www.eleuther.ai/">EleutherAI</a> community has become a leading open-source ML lab, releasing pre-trained models and code libraries that have enabled foundational research and reduced the barriers to developing large AI models.</p>



<p>Similarly, the <a href="https://bigscience.huggingface.co/">BigScience</a> project, which brought together over 1200 multidisciplinary researchers, highlights the importance of facilitating direct access to AI components across institutions and disciplines.</p>



<p>Such open collaborations have democratised access to large AI models, enabling researchers to fine-tune and adapt them to various languages and specific tasks—ultimately contributing to a more diverse and representative AI landscape.</p>



<p>Open research and development also promote transparency and accountability in AI systems. For example, <a href="https://laion.ai/">LAION</a> – a non-profit research organisation – released openCLIP models, which have been instrumental in identifying and addressing biases in AI applications. Open access to training data and model components has enabled researchers and the public to scrutinise the inner workings of AI systems and challenge misleading or erroneous claims.</p>



<p>The AI Act&#8217;s success depends on striking a balance between regulation and support for the open AI ecosystem. While openness and transparency are essential, regulation must also mitigate risks, ensure standards, and establish clear liability for AI systems&#8217; potential harms.</p>



<p>As the EU sets the stage for regulating AI, embracing open source and open science will be critical to ensure that AI technology benefits all citizens.</p>



<p>By implementing the recommendations provided by organisations representing stakeholders in the open AI ecosystem, the AI Act can foster an environment of collaboration, transparency, and innovation, making Europe a leader in the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.</p>
