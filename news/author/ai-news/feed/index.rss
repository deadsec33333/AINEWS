<p>In a world where artificial intelligence is becoming omnipresent, it&#8217;s fascinating to think about the prospect of AI-powered robots and digital avatars that can experience emotions, similar to humans.</p>



<p>AI models lack consciousness and they don&#8217;t have the capacity to feel emotions, but what possibilities might arise if that were to change?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The birth of emotional AI</h3>



<p>The prospect of an AI system embracing those first sparks of emotion is perhaps not as far-fetched as one might think. Already, AI systems have some ability to<a href="https://www.inverse.com/science/how-good-is-ai-at-detecting-human-emotions-too-good"> gauge people&#8217;s emotions</a>, and increasingly they&#8217;re also able to<a href="https://www.justthink.ai/blog/emotional-intelligence-in-ai-chat-the-next-frontier"> replicate those feelings</a> in their interactions with humans.</p>



<p>It still requires a leap of faith to imagine an AI that could <em>feel</em> genuine emotions, but if it ever becomes possible, we&#8217;d imagine that they&#8217;ll be somewhat basic at first, similar to those of a child. Perhaps, an AI system might be able to feel joy at successfully completing a task, or maybe even confusion when presented with a challenge it doesn&#8217;t know how to solve. From there, it&#8217;s not difficult to envision that feeling of confusion evolving to one of frustration at its repeated failures to tackle the problem in question. And as this system evolves further, perhaps its emotional spectrum might expand to even feel a tinge of sadness or regret.</p>



<p>Should AI ever be able to feel such emotions, it wouldn&#8217;t be long before they could express more nuanced feelings, like excitement, impatience, and empathy for humans and other AIs. For instance, in a scenario where an AI system acquires a new skill or solves a new kind of problem, it might be able to experience a degree of satisfaction in success. This is similar to how humans feel when they solve a particularly taxing challenge, like a complex jigsaw puzzle, or when they do something for the first time, like driving a car.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Empathy as a motivator</h3>



<p>As AI&#8217;s ability to feel emotion evolves, it would become increasingly complex, progressing to a stage where it can even feel empathy for others. Empathy is one of the most complex human emotions, involving understanding and sharing the feelings of someone else.</p>



<p>If AI can experience such feelings, they may inspire it to become more helpful, similar to how humans are sometimes motivated to help someone less fortunate.</p>



<p>An AI that&#8217;s designed to assist human doctors might feel sad for someone who is afflicted by a mysterious illness. The feelings might push it to try harder to find a diagnosis for the rare disease that person is suffering from. If it gets it right, the AI might feel an overwhelming sense of accomplishment at doing so, knowing that the afflicted patient will be able to receive the treatment they need.</p>



<p>Or we can consider an AI system that&#8217;s built to detect changes to an environment. If such a system were to recognise a substantial increase in pollution in a certain area, it might feel disappointed or even saddened by such a discovery. But like with humans, the feelings might also inspire the AI to find ways to prevent this new source of pollution, perhaps by inventing a more efficient way to recycle or dispose of the toxic substance responsible.</p>



<p>In a similar way, an AI system that encounters numerous errors in a dataset might be compelled to refine its algorithm to reduce the number of errors.</p>



<p>This would also have a direct impact on human-to-AI interactions. It&#8217;s not hard to imagine that an AI-powered customer service bot that feels empathy for a customer might be willing to go the extra mile to help resolve that person&#8217;s problem. Or alternatively, we might get AI teachers with a better understanding of their students&#8217; emotions, which can then adapt teaching methods appropriately.</p>



<p>Empathetic AI could transform the way we treat people with mental health issues. The<a href="https://aicompetence.org/ai-for-mental-health-chatbots-digital-therapists/"> concept of a digital therapist</a> is not new, but if a digital therapist can better relate to their patients on an emotional level, it can figure out how best to support them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is this even possible?</h3>



<p>Surprisingly, we may not be that far off. AI systems like<a href="https://antix.in"> Antix</a> are already capable of expressing artificial empathy. It&#8217;s a platform for creating digital humans that are programmed to respond sympathetically when they recognise feelings of frustration, anger or upset in the people they interact with. Its digital humans can detect people&#8217;s emotions based on their speech, the kinds of words they use, intonation, and body language.</p>



<p>The ability of Antix&#8217;s digital humans to understand emotion is partly based on the way they are trained. Each digital human is a unique<a href="https://token.antix.in"> non-fungible token or NFT</a> that learns over time from its users, gaining more knowledge and evolving so it can adapt its interactions in response to an individual&#8217;s behaviour or preferences.</p>



<p>Because digital humans can recognise emotions and replicate them, they have the potential to deliver more profound and meaningful experiences. Antix utilises the Unreal Engine 5 platform to give its creations a more realistic appearance. Creators can alter almost every aspect of their digital humans, including the voice and appearance, with the ability to edit skin tone, eye colour, and small details like eyebrows and facial hair.</p>



<p>What sets Antix apart from other AI platforms is that users can customise the behaviour of their digital humans, to provide the most appropriate emotional response in different scenarios. Thus, digital humans can respond with an appropriate tone of voice, making the right gestures and expressions when they&#8217;re required to feel sad, for example, before transforming in an instant to express excitement, happiness, or joy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AI is getting real</h3>



<p>Emotional AI systems are a work in progress, and the result will be digital humans that feel more lifelike in any scenario where they can be useful.</p>



<p>The CEO of Zoom has talked about the emergence of AI-powered digital twins that can<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24168733/zoom-ceo-ai-clones-digital-twins-videoconferencing-decoder-interview"> participate in video calls</a> on their user&#8217;s behalf, allowing the user to be in two places at once, so to speak. If the digital human version of your boss can express empathy, satisfaction, excitement and anger, the concept would be more effective, fostering a more realistic connection, even if the real boss isn&#8217;t present in their physical form.</p>



<p>A customer service-focused digital human that&#8217;s able to empathise with callers will likely have a tremendous impact on customer satisfaction, and a sympathetic digital teacher might find ways to elicit more positive responses from its students, accelerating the speed at which they learn.</p>



<p>With digital humans capable of expressing emotions, the potential for more realistic, lifelike, and immersive experiences is almost limitless, and it will result in more rewarding and beneficial interactions with AI systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence and its associated innovations have revamped the global technological landscape, with <a href="https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/artificial-intelligence-jobs/">recent data</a> released by the US government predicting 13% growth in IT-related opportunities over the next six years – potentially adding 667,600 new jobs to the sector.</p>



<p>Researchers have stated that by 2034, the AI sector&#8217;s cumulative valuation may reach <a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/artificial-intelligence-market">$3.6 trillion</a> across industry. The healthcare sector has already integrated AI-based diagnostic tools, with <a href="https://bluetree.digital/ai-industry-growth-metrics/">38% of today&#8217;s major medical providers</a> using the technology.</p>



<p>The financial sector is also expecting AI to contribute approximately <a href="https://bluetree.digital/ai-industry-growth-metrics/">$15.7 trillion</a> to the global economy by 2030, and the retail industry <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier">anticipates</a> anywhere between $400 billion and $660 billion through AI-driven customer experiences annually.</p>



<p>It is estimated that approximately <a href="https://bluetree.digital/ai-industry-growth-metrics/">83% of companies</a> now have AI exploration as an agenda item for continued technical growth, especially given its capacity to drive innovation, enhance efficiency, and create sustainable competitive advantage.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Decentralising AI&#8217;s foundations</h3>



<p>While AI&#8217;s potential is seemingly limitless, its rapid growth has brought a challenge – the centralisation of AI development and data management.</p>



<p>As AI systems become more sophisticated, risks like dataset manipulation, biased training models, and opaque decision-making processes <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375744287ArtificialIntelligenceandEthicsAComprehensiveReviewofBiasMitigationTransparencyandAccountabilityinAISystems">threaten to undermine</a> their potential.</p>



<p>Different blockchain tech providers have taken steps to decentralise the sector, offering infrastructure frameworks that change how AI systems are developed, trained, and deployed.</p>



<p>Space and Time (SXT) has devised a verifiable database that aims to bridge the gap between disparate areas, providing users with transparent, secure development tools that mean AI agents can execute transactions with greater levels data integrity.</p>



<p>The platform&#8217;s innovation lies in its ability to provide contextual data which AI agents can use for executing trades and purchases in ways that end-users can validate.</p>



<p>Another project of note is Chromia. It takes a similar approach, with a focus on creating a decentralised architecture to handle complex, data-intensive AI applications. Speaking about the platform&#8217;s capabilities, Yeou Jie Goh, Head of Business Development at Chromia, said:</p>



<p>&#8220;Our relational blockchain is specifically designed to support AI applications, performing hundreds of read-write operations per transaction and indexing data in real-time. We&#8217;re not just building a blockchain; we&#8217;re creating the infrastructure for the next generation of AI development.&#8221;</p>



<p>Chromia wants to lower the barriers to entry for data scientists and machine learning engineers.</p>



<p>By providing a SQL-based relational blockchain, the platform makes it easier for technical professionals to build and deploy AI applications on decentralised infrastructure. &#8220;Our mission is to position Chromia as the transparency layer of Web3, providing a robust backbone for data integrity across applications,&#8221; Goh said.</p>



<p>Chromia has already <a href="https://blog.chromia.com/chromia-and-chasm-network/">formed partnerships</a> with Elfa AI, Chasm Network, and Stork.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing a roadmap for technological sovereignty</h3>



<p>The synergy between AI and blockchain is more than a fad, rather, a reimagining of AI’s infrastructure. Space and Time, for instance, is working to expand its ecosystem in multiple domains, including AI, DeFi, gaming, and decentralised physical infrastructure networks (DePIN).</p>



<p>Its strategy focuses on onboarding developers and building a mainnet that delivers verifiable data to smart contracts and AI agents.</p>



<p>Chromia is ambitious, <a href="https://chainwire.org/2024/09/18/chromia-announces-20m-data-and-ai-ecosystem-fund-and-upcoming-asgard-mainnet-upgrade/">launching a $20 million</a> Data and AI Ecosystem Fund earlier this year. The project&#8217;s &#8216;Asgard Mainnet Upgrade&#8217; with an &#8216;Extensions&#8217; feature offers users adaptable application use.</p>



<p>The implications of AI&#8217;s shift toward decentralisation is of significant interest to Nate Holiday, CEO of Space and Time. He predicts that blockchain-based transactions associated with AI agents could grow from the current 3% of the market to 30% in the near future. He said:</p>



<p>&#8220;Ushering in this inevitable, near-term future is going to require data infrastructure like SXT that provides AI agents with the context that they need to execute trades and purchases in a way that the end user can verify.&#8221;</p>



<p>Chromia&#8217;s Yeou Jie Goh sees the transition not just as a technological innovation but as a means of creating a more transparent, secure, and democratised technological ecosystem. By using blockchain&#8217;s inherent strengths – immutability, transparency, and decentralisation – the two companies are working to create intelligent systems that are powerful, accountable, ethical, and aligned with human values.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In just a few years, the realm of AI has transcended its initial computational boundaries, emerging as <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity">one of the transformative forces</a> of the 21st century, permeating virtually every major economic sector.</p>



<p>The global AI market was valued at $638.23 billion during Q4 2024, and is projected to reach a <a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/artificial-intelligence-market">valuation of $3.6 trillion</a> by 2034, largely because AI has the potential to gain widespread adoption in multiple industries.</p>



<p>For instance, in healthcare, <a href="https://bluetree.digital/ai-industry-growth-metrics/">38% of all major medical providers</a> use advanced AI diagnostic tools. Similarly, the financial sector has also demonstrated impressive integrations, with AI projected to <a href="https://bluetree.digital/ai-industry-growth-metrics/">contribute approx. $15.7 trillion</a> to the global economy by 2030.</p>



<p>The retail industry has also set its sights on anywhere between<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier"> $400 billion and $660 billion</a> annually thanks to AI-driven customer experiences, while the cybersecurity sector is set to register a<a href="https://bluetree.digital/ai-industry-growth-metrics/"> 23.6% growth rate</a> – by 2027 – because of AI-powered intelligent security technologies.</p>



<p>It is estimated that about<a href="https://bluetree.digital/ai-industry-growth-metrics/"> 83% of companies</a> have already begun considering AI as a strategic priority, recognising its potential to drive innovation, enhance efficiency, and create competitive advantages.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Simplifying everyday life with AI</h3>



<p>With the global tech landscape having transformed over the last couple of years, we are now at a point where AI is starting to automate various mundane and time-consuming everyday tasks.</p>



<p>The concept of &#8216;AI twins&#8217; has gained traction recently, allowing individuals to manage scheduling, respond to emails, conduct research, and handle complex administrative tasks efficiently.</p>



<p>These digital companions represent more than just a caricature of a person&#8217;s real-world identity; they offer productivity accelerators designed to liberate anyone from repetitive work cycles (thus allowing them to focus on more creative, strategic, or emotionally nuanced tasks).</p>



<p>They can also help reduce the cognitive and emotional burden of managing multiple responsibilities, which could otherwise be overwhelming for some.</p>



<p>Leading this revolution is<a href="https://twinprotocol.com/"> Twin Protocol</a>, a platform that seeks to redefine how humans interact with AI, primarily via the creation of secure, dynamic digital representations that can learn, adapt, and evolve alongside their human counterparts.</p>



<p>By using the power of trained machine learning algorithms and decentralised ledgers, Twin Protocol allows individuals to develop digital twins that can capture not just information, but individual expertise and personality traits.</p>



<p>The platform&#8217;s potential spans industries, ranging from healthcare to manufacturing and finance. Imagine possessing the ability to deploy a perpetually-available AI twin that can provide personalised healthcare advice, or a digital representation of a financial advisor offering real-time, context-aware investment strategies.</p>



<p>These twins aren&#8217;t designed to serve as mere information repositories but as intelligent and dynamic tools capable of understanding context, learning continuously, and providing nuanced, personalised interactions.</p>



<p>What sets Twin Protocol apart is its commitment to maintaining individual agency and data privacy. Through its blockchain-based &#8216;<a href="https://twinprotocol.gitbook.io/twin-protocol-ai-utility-token/white-paper/twin-vault">Twin Vault</a>&#8216;, users can retain control over their digital identity, ensuring that personal information remains secure.</p>



<p>Thanks to its unique proposition, the platform has attracted several collaborations, including<a href="https://medium.com/@twinprotocol/highlighting-the-strategic-partnership-between-twin-protocol-and-singularitynet-95b050eb0cab"> partnerships</a> with SingularityNET and<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deepak-chopra-previews-ai-twin-133000535.html"> notable figures</a> like Deepak Chopra and Robert Bell (founding member of Kool &amp; the Gang).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AI&#8217;s potential is still uncharted</h3>



<p>It is estimated that over the coming decade, AI&#8217;s potential could <a href="https://www.statista.com/site/insights-compass-ai-ai-market-overview">grow hugely</a>, with offerings like Twin Protocol demonstrating next-generation technology, allowing users to explore new concepts like digital twins.</p>



<p>From personalised education to industrial optimisation, AI is moving beyond the category of being a tool, becoming a transformative partner capable of extending individual capabilities.</p>



<p>AI&#8217;s journey and symbiosis is likely to push the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible today. Some of the most exciting innovations emanating from the field will lie not in the technology, but in how its potential is applied to other fields. Interesting times are ahead!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence entered the market with a splash, driving massive buzz and adoption. But now the pace is faltering.</p>



<p>Business leaders still talk the talk about embracing AI, because they want the benefits – McKinsey estimates that GenAI could save companies up to<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier"> $2.6 trillion across</a> a range of operations. However, they aren&#8217;t walking the walk. According to one survey of senior analytics and IT leaders,<a href="https://blog.dataiku.com/bridge-the-modern-analytics-gap"> only 20% of GenAI applications</a> are currently in production.</p>



<p>Why the wide gap between interest and reality?</p>



<p>The answer is multifaceted. Concerns around security and data privacy, compliance risks, and data management are high-profile, but there&#8217;s also anxiety about AI&#8217;s lack of transparency and worries about ROI, costs, and skill gaps. In this article, we&#8217;ll examine the barriers to AI adoption, and share some measures that business leaders can take to overcome them.</p>

<p>&#8220;High-quality data is the cornerstone of accurate and reliable AI models, which in turn drive better decision-making and outcomes,&#8221;<a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/solarwinds-it-professionals-stronger-ai-regulation/"> said Rob Johnson</a>, VP and Global Head of Solutions Engineering at SolarWinds, adding, &#8220;Trustworthy data builds confidence in AI among IT professionals, accelerating the broader adoption and integration of AI technologies.&#8221;</p>



<p>Today, only 43% of IT professionals say they&#8217;re confident about their ability to meet AI&#8217;s data demands. Given that data is so vital for AI success, it&#8217;s not surprising that data challenges are an oft-cited factor in slow AI adoption.</p>



<p>The best way to overcome this hurdle is to go back to data basics. Organisations need to build a strong data governance strategy from the ground up, with rigorous controls that enforce data quality and integrity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Take ethics and governance seriously</h3>



<p>With regulations mushrooming, compliance is already a headache for many organisations. AI only adds new areas of risk, more regulations, and increased ethical governance issues for business leaders to worry about, to the extent that security and compliance risk<a href="https://www.cloudera.com/campaign/the-state-of-enterprise-ai-and-modern-data-architecture.html?internalkeyplay=cross&amp;internalcampaign=Thought-Leadership-Reports%E2%80%93FY25-Q2-GLOBAL-ME-Sponsored-GenAI-MDA-Survey-PR&amp;cid=701Hr000001ffvDIAQ&amp;internallink=blog-body-content"> was the most-cited concern</a> in Cloudera&#8217;s State of Enterprise AI and Modern Data Architecture report.</p>



<p>While the rise in AI regulations might seem alarming at first, executives should embrace the support that these frameworks offer, as they can give organisations a structure around which to build their own risk controls and ethical guardrails.</p>



<p>Developing compliance policies, appointing teams for AI governance, and ensuring that humans retain authority over AI-powered decisions are all important steps in creating a comprehensive system of AI ethics and governance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reinforce control over security and privacy</h3>



<p>Security and data privacy concerns loom large for every business, and with good reason. Cisco&#8217;s 2024 Data Privacy Benchmark Study revealed that<a href="https://investor.cisco.com/news/news-details/2024/More-than-1-in-4-Organisations-Banned-Use-of-GenAI-Over-Privacy-and-Data-Security-Risks%E2%80%93New-Cisco-Study/default.aspx"> 48% of employees</a> admit to entering non-public company information into GenAI tools (and an unknown number have done so and won&#8217;t admit it), leading 27% of organisations to ban the use of such tools.</p>



<p>The best way to reduce the risks is to limit access to sensitive data. This involves doubling down on access controls and privilege creep, and keeping data away from publicly-hosted LLMs. Avi Perez, CTO of Pyramid Analytics, explained that his business intelligence software&#8217;s AI infrastructure was deliberately built to<a href="https://www.pyramidanalytics.com/blog/what-is-generative-bi/"> keep data away from the LLM</a>, sharing only metadata that describes the problem and interfacing with the LLM as the best way for locally-hosted engines to run analysis.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a huge set of issues there. It&#8217;s not just about privacy, it&#8217;s also about misleading results. So in that framework, data privacy and the issues associated with it are tremendous, in my opinion. They&#8217;re a showstopper,&#8221;<a href="https://happyfutureai.com/revolutionising-business-intelligence-with-llm-chatbots/"> Perez said</a>. With Pyramid&#8217;s setup, however, &#8220;the LLM generates the recipe, but it does it without ever getting [its] hands on the data, and without doing mathematical operations. […] That eliminates something like 95% of the problem, in terms of data privacy risks.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Boost transparency and explainability</h3>



<p>Another serious obstacle to AI adoption is a lack of trust in its results. The infamous story of Amazon&#8217;s AI-powered hiring tool which discriminated against women has become a cautionary tale that scares many people away from AI. The best way to combat this fear is to increase explainability and transparency.</p>



<p>&#8220;AI transparency is about clearly explaining the reasoning behind the output, making the decision-making process accessible and comprehensible,&#8221;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/tip/AI-transparency-What-is-it-and-why-do-we-need-it"> said Adnan Masood</a>, chief AI architect at UST and a Microsoft regional director. &#8220;At the end of the day, it&#8217;s about eliminating the black box mystery of AI and providing insight into the how and why of AI decision-making.&#8221;Unfortunately, many executives overlook the importance of transparency. A recent IBM study reported that<a href="https://www.bigdatawire.com/this-just-in/ibm-study-c-suite-executives-voice-growing-doubts-about-it-amid-genai-investments/"> only 45% of CEOs</a> say they are delivering on capabilities for openness. AI champions need to prioritise the development of rigorous AI governance policies that prevent black boxes arising, and invest in explainability tools like SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAPs), fairness toolkits like Google&#8217;s Fairness Indicators, and automated compliance checks like the Institute of Internal Auditors&#8217; AI Auditing Framework.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Define clear business value</h3>



<p>Cost is on the list of AI barriers, as always. The Cloudera survey found that 26% of respondents said AI tools are too expensive, and Gartner included &#8220;unclear business value&#8221; as a factor in the failure of AI projects. Yet the same Gartner report noted that GenAI had delivered an average revenue increase and cost savings of over 15% among its users, proof that AI can drive financial lift if implemented correctly.</p>



<p>This is why it&#8217;s crucial to approach AI like every other business project – identify areas that will deliver fast ROI, define the benefits you expect to see, and set specific KPIs so you can prove value.&#8221;While there&#8217;s a lot that goes into building out an AI strategy and roadmap, a critical first step is to identify the most valuable and transformative AI use cases on which to focus,&#8221;<a href="https://www.uipath.com/blog/ai/overcome-ai-adoption-barriers"> said Michael Robinson</a>, Director of Product Marketing at UiPath.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Set up effective training programs</h3>



<p>The skills gap remains a significant roadblock to AI adoption, but it seems that little effort is being made to address the issue. A report from Worklife indicates the initial boom in AI adoption came from early adopters. Now, it&#8217;s down to the laggards, who are inherently sceptical and generally less confident about AI – and any new tech.</p>



<p>This makes training crucial. Yet according to Asana&#8217;s State of AI at Work study,<a href="https://asana.com/resources/state-of-ai-work-2024-thank-you"> 82% of participants said</a> their organisations haven&#8217;t provided training on using generative AI. There&#8217;s no indication that training isn&#8217;t working; rather that it isn&#8217;t happening as it should.</p>



<p>The clear takeaway is to offer comprehensive training in quality prompting and other relevant skills. Encouragingly, the same research shows that even using AI without training increases people&#8217;s skills and confidence. So, it&#8217;s a good idea to get started with low- and no-code tools that allow employees who are unskilled in AI to learn on the job.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The barriers to AI adoption are not insurmountable</h3>



<p>Although AI adoption has slowed, there&#8217;s no indication that it&#8217;s in danger in the long term. The many obstacles holding companies back from rolling out AI tools can be overcome without too much trouble. Many of the steps, like reinforcing data quality and ethical governance, should be taken regardless of whether or not AI is under consideration, while other steps taken will pay for themselves in increased revenue and the productivity gains that AI can bring.&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Layer 1 relational blockchain Chromia unveils its Asgard mainnet upgrade.</strong></li>



<li><strong>Includes new extensions that add specialised capabilities to the blockchain.</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Oracle Extension has launched with the AI Inference Extension expected early next year.</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The<a href="https://chromia.com/"> Chromia</a> blockchain development team has announced the successful completion of its Asgard mainnet upgrade that introduces new features and capabilities for the platform. The new features enhance the overall capacity of the Layer 1 blockchain and add specialised capabilities for users.</p>



<p>The Asgard mainnet upgrade includes the launch of Chomia Extensions, expected to support the growth of decentralised finance (DeFi) and AI-enabled applications on the Chromia Network.</p>



<p>Announced on November 15, the Chromia team believes the mainnet will redesign how data is organised on the blockchain, changing the development and use of Web 3 applications. The blockchain utilises a modular framework to offer users and developers of decentralised application (dApp) chains, customisable fee structures, and advanced digital assets.</p>



<p>The extensions are modular enhancements that enable developers to build additional features on top of the main blockchain, expanding functionality and utility while maintaining the benefits of the existing infrastructure. The Extensions complement the platform&#8217;s relational data architecture, modular network design, and gas-free economic model for end users.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Chromia launches Oracle Extensions</h3>



<p>The Oracle Extension]] provides fully on-chain, real-time price feeds that are updated approximately once a second. It provides developers in Chromia&#8217;s ecosystem the ability to develop DeFi applications like decentralised exchanges, futures and options platforms, and lending protocols.</p>



<p>Ludvig Öberg, VP of the Chromia Platform Unit said he believes the Oracle Extension will help grow the DeFi space on the blockchain. &#8220;The Oracle Extension lays the groundwork for an expansion of decentralised finance activity on the Chromia network and the growth of network value.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the team statement, the launch of the Oracle Extension purports to bond well with the overall goal of &#8220;strengthening connections across the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.&#8221; The company has made recent efforts to integrate native CHR tokens and other Chromia-based tokens with centralised exchanges and cross-chain wallets.</p>



<p>Chromia plans to release a public demo of the Oracle Extension, with integrations by DeFi protocols expected soon after.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AI Inference Extension to launch early 2025</h3>



<p>Chromia has also announced it has plans to launch an AI Inference Extension, expected in Q1 2025. The module will enable developers to execute AI models directly on-chain using Chromia&#8217;s decentralised provider network. The project&#8217;s recently formed Data and AI Division&#8217;s focus is on creating tools to enhance transparency in AI training data and inputs.</p>



<p>Speaking about the AI Extension&#8217;s planned launch, Yeou Jie, Head of Business Development at Chromia, said their team&#8217;s plan is to expand &#8220;transparency to AI.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;As the world&#8217;s only relational blockchain, Chromia has demonstrated its ability to bring transparency to AI and other data-intensive use cases. The AI Inference Extension will take this a step further, enabling on-chain execution of AI models.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Seen as the first major technical update on Chromia, Asgard mainnet provides a way for the blockchain to support other functions and decentralised applications including AI, gaming, finance, and enterprise use-cases.</p>

<p><a href="https://agentfun.ai/">AgentFun.AI</a>, a platform to create and trade AI agents, went live on November 27 on<a href="https://cronos.org/zkevm"> Cronos zkEVM</a>. It became the first decentralised app dedicated to AI agents in the Cronos ecosystem. Users can create, build, and trade tokenised AI agents on AgentFun.AI. They set growth milestones for the agents, which have individual personalities. Agents accumulate fans and become trade-able assets with each milestone reached. Each agent can interact with users on the blockchain and on social media.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Exploring the appeal of trading tokenised AI agents</h3>



<p>Users can own a fraction of high-value AI models, lowering the barrier to AI ecosystem entry. These tokens often operate on decentralised platforms, increasing transparency, security, and cross-platform integration. Users across the globe can participate in funding and developing innovative AI models, accelerating AI adoption.</p>



<p>Creating an agent through AgentFun.AI starts with buying a small amount of AGENTFUN tokens on H2 Finance, a leading decentralised exchange (DEX) on Cronos zkEVM. Each agent generated requires a nominal fee of 1 $AGENTFUN. The entire process of creating and training AI agents has been gamified, further encouraging users to use the platform.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="602" height="147" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Picture22.png" alt="" class="wp-image-16593" srcset="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Picture22.png 602w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Picture22-300x73.png 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Picture22-380x93.png 380w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Picture22-350x85.png 350w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Picture22-100x24.png 100w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Picture22-60x15.png 60w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Picture22-600x147.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Agent capabilities increase in direct proportion to demand</h3>



<p>As the AI agents grow, they obtain new capabilities, with rising demand from other users on Cronos zkEVM unlocking new features. As an agent reaches the fixed market cap of $127,100, it becomes capable of engaging in Telegram chats. It cultivates a liquidity pool on Cronos&#8217; DEX, alleviating trading and discoverability in the ecosystem.</p>



<p>Additional features are unlocked as agents attain milestone-based targets. An agent that reaches the market cap of $1.27 million starts interacting on X. Its growth is essentially unlimited, giving users a strong incentive to network in the ecosystem that AgentFun.AI has helped build.</p>



<p>Further encouragement is provided by the fact that users can create AI agents with unique personalities and narratives. Each agent starts as a tailored language model for conversational interactions before it gains new capabilities, features, and skills. In other words, the agents are designed for specific tasks or domains, using a customised language model at their core. Unlike general-purpose AI, they are fine-tuned on highly specialised datasets to excel in a particular area. Over time, they can theoretically evolve by incorporating autonomous decision-making and API integration and communicating with other systems, like interacting with users in dynamic environments. They could perform tasks using logic-based or reinforcement learning modules or fetch and process real-time data.</p>



<p>When a user creates an agent, they provide social links to facilitate socialisation and discovery. A new agent token is launched in a pool with a supply of one billion. The agent token will eventually be listed on H2 Finance as more users buy it, using the $AGENTFUN earned from sold tokens and the remaining token supply.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Supporting Cronos as a leading AI-agent-powered ecosystem</h3>



<p>A final notable aspect of AgentFun.AI&#8217;s launch is its support of Cronos&#8217; strategy to become one of the first niche, AI agent-powered ecosystems. As part of this, it will stimulate experimentation and adoption of the first AI agents on Cronos zkEVM. The may encourage other developers to introduce AI agent dApps, leading to a flood of innovation on Cronos.The launch of AgentFun.AI on Cronos aligns with the latter&#8217;s mission to build a financial ecosystem with<a href="https://docs-zkevm.cronos.org/getting-started/cronos-roadmap"> openness, fairness, and community empowerment</a> at its core. Cronos envisions a future enabled primarily by AI agents where decentralised finance is universally accessible, which aligns with its conviction that the agents can provide unlimited growth opportunities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Blockchain AI research lab<a href="https://yeager.ai/"> YeagerAI</a> has announced the launch of the Intelligent Oracle, an AI-powered oracle that aims to provide decentralised applications (DApps) with online data on-chain. The Oracle can change how data is collected, offering new possibilities and use cases for blockchain DApps. It is built on the GenLayer blockchain, also a brainchild of YeagerAI, and designed to support a new generation of DApps. It can fetch any type of online data and deliver it on-chain.</p>



<p>The Intelligent Oracle will initially launch on a permissioned local network, with the GenLayer Testnet expected operational by the end of 2024. By removing the dependency on human-powered resolution systems and offering cross-chain compatibility, the Intelligent Oracle aims to provide a scalable, efficient, and future-proof solution for decision-making.</p>



<p>The Intelligent Oracle is powered by LLMs integrated in GenLayer&#8217;s Optimistic Democracy consensus mechanism. The consensus mechanism is &#8216;governed&#8217; by validators that connect to LLMs, verifying and securing the data that the Oracle fetches from on- and off-chain sources. The validators enable the network to process non-deterministic transactions by fetching data from the internet.</p>



<p>When a query is made, a lead validator generates a proposed result, while other validators independently verify the output against the pre-set equivalence criteria. Optimistic Democracy ensures all decisions are accurate, reliable, and secure.</p>



<p>While blockchain oracles have evolved rapidly in the past few years, there remain several pertinent unresolved issues. Among them are the inability of blockchains to access external data, and blockchains only able to access what is available on-chain. The emerging uses of blockchains are impacted by the lack of broader oracles, with most futuristic DApps requiring immediate, accurate, and sometimes subjective data from the internet.</p>



<p>To date, the solution has been to use traditional oracles, which only provide pre-defined datasets or require manual intervention, making them slow, costly, and inflexible. The Intelligent Oracle offers an autonomous solution, offering a virtually unlimited range of data types to dApp builders.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Welcoming Intelligent Oracle: A new world of blockchain use cases</h3>



<p>The Intelligent Oracle is based on Intelligent Contracts operating on the GenLayer blockchain. The oracle operates in the GenLayer ecosystem, allowing users to fetch decentralised, transparent and secure data for their DApps or platforms. It offers cross-chain compatibility, allowing it to integrate with multiple blockchain ecosystems.</p>



<p>Following the launch, blockchain DApp developers have significantly more possibilities open to them. The launch of the Intelligent Oracle could be a step forward for decentralised applications in prediction markets, insurance, and financial derivatives, for example.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>AI is rapidly becoming ubiquitous across business systems and IT ecosystems, with adoption and development racing faster than anyone could have expected. Today it seems that everywhere we turn, software engineers are building custom models and integrating AI into their products, as business leaders incorporate AI-powered solutions in their working environments.</p>



<p>However, uncertainty about the best way to implement AI is stopping some companies from taking action. Boston Consulting Group&#8217;s latest Digital Acceleration Index (DAI), a global survey of 2,700 executives, revealed that<a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-to-prepare-for-ai-regulation"> only 28% say</a> their organisation is fully prepared for new AI regulation.</p>



<p>Their uncertainty is exacerbated by AI regulations arriving thick and fast: the<a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/balancing-innovation-trust-experts-assess-eu-ai-act/"> EU AI act is on the way</a>; Argentina released a draft AI plan; Canada has the AI and Data Act; China has enacted a slew of AI regulations; and the G7 nations launched the &#8220;Hiroshima AI process.&#8221; Guidelines abound, with the OECD developing AI principles, the UN proposing a new UN AI advisory body, and the Biden administration releasing a blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights (although that could quickly change with the second Trump administration).</p>



<p>Legislation is also coming in individual US states, and is appearing in many industry frameworks. To date, 21 states have enacted laws to regulate AI use in some manner, including the Colourado AI Act, and clauses in California&#8217;s CCPA, plus a further 14 states have legislation awaiting approval.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, there are loud voices on both sides of the AI regulation debate. A new survey from SolarWinds shows<a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/solarwinds-it-professionals-stronger-ai-regulation/"> 88% of IT professionals advocate</a> for stronger regulation, and separate research reveals that<a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/uk-announces-over-100m-support-agile-ai-regulation/"> 91% of British people</a> want the government to do more to hold businesses accountable for their AI systems. On the other hand, the leaders of over 50 tech companies<a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/tech-industry-giants-urge-eu-streamline-ai-regulations/"> recently wrote an open letter</a> calling for urgent reform of the EU&#8217;s heavy AI regulations, arguing that they stifle innovation.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s certainly a tricky period for business leaders and software developers, as regulators scramble to catch up with tech. Of course you want to take advantage of the benefits AI can provide, you can do so in a way that sets you up for compliance with whatever regulatory requirements are coming, and don&#8217;t handicap your AI use unnecessarily while your rivals speed ahead.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t have a crystal ball, so we can&#8217;t predict the future. But we can share some best practices for setting up systems and procedures that will prepare the ground for AI regulatory compliance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Map out AI usage in your wider ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>You can&#8217;t manage your team&#8217;s AI use unless you know about it, but that alone can be a significant challenge. Shadow IT is already the scourge of cybersecurity teams: Employees sign up for SaaS tools without the knowledge of IT departments, leaving an unknown number of solutions and platforms with access to business data and/or systems.</p>



<p>Now security teams also have to grapple with shadow AI. Many apps, chatbots, and other tools incorporate AI, machine learning (ML), or natural language programming (NLP), without such solutions necessarily being obvious AI solutions. When employees log into these solutions without official approval, they bring AI into your systems without your knowledge.</p>



<p>As Opice Blum&#8217;s data privacy expert<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/establishing-governance-for-ai-systems"> Henrique Fabretti Moraes explained</a>, &#8220;Mapping the tools in use – or those intended for use – is crucial for understanding and fine-tuning acceptable use policies and potential mitigation measures to decrease the risks involved in their utilisation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some regulations hold you responsible for AI use by vendors. To take full control of the situation, you need to map all the AI in your, and your partner organisations&#8217; environments. In this regard, using a tool like<a href="https://www.harmonic.security/blog-posts/how-to-detect-and-mitigate-shadow-ai-in-your-organisation"> Harmonic</a> can be instrumental in detecting AI use across the supply chain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Verify data governance</strong></h2>



<p>Data privacy and security are core concerns for all AI regulations, both those already in place and those on the brink of approval.</p>



<p>Your AI use already needs to comply with existing privacy laws like GDPR and CCPR, which require you to know what data your AI can access and what it does with the data, and for you to demonstrate guardrails to protect the data AI uses.</p>



<p>To ensure compliance, you need to put robust data governance rules into place in your organisation, managed by a defined team, and backed up by regular audits. Your policies should include due diligence to evaluate data security and sources of all your tools, including those that use AI, to identify areas of potential bias and privacy risk.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is incumbent on organisations to take proactive measures by enhancing data hygiene, enforcing robust AI ethics and assembling the right teams to lead these efforts,&#8221;<a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/uk-announces-over-100m-support-agile-ai-regulation/"> said Rob Johnson</a>, VP and Global Head of Solutions Engineering at SolarWinds. &#8220;This proactive stance not only helps with compliance with evolving regulations but also maximises the potential of AI.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Establish continuous monitoring for your AI systems</strong></h2>



<p>Effective monitoring is crucial for managing any area of your business. When it comes to AI, as with other areas of cybersecurity, you need continuous monitoring to ensure that you know what your AI tools are doing, how they are behaving, and what data they are accessing. You also need to audit them regularly to keep on top of AI use in your organisation.</p>



<p>&#8220;The idea of using AI to monitor and regulate other AI systems is a crucial development in ensuring these systems are both effective and ethical,&#8221;<a href="https://www.informationweek.com/machine-learning-ai/how-to-monitor-ai-with-ai"> said Cache Merrill</a>, founder of software development company Zibtek. &#8220;Currently, techniques like machine learning models that predict other models&#8217; behaviours (meta-models) are employed to monitor AI. The systems analyse patterns and outputs of operational AI to detect anomalies, biases or potential failures before they become critical.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cyber GRC automation platform<a href="https://cypago.com/"> Cypago</a> allows you to run continuous monitoring and regulatory audit evidence collection in the background. The no-code automation allows you to set custom workflow capabilities without technical expertise, so alerts and mitigation actions are triggered instantly according to the controls and thresholds you set up.</p>



<p>Cypago can connect with your various digital platforms, synchronise with virtually any regulatory framework, and turn all relevant controls into automated workflows. Once your integrations and regulatory frameworks are set up, creating custom workflows on the platform is as simple as uploading a spreadsheet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Use risk assessments as your guidelines</strong></h2>



<p>It&#8217;s vital to know which of your AI tools are high risk, medium risk, and low risk – for compliance with external regulations, for internal business risk management, and for improving software development workflows. High risk use cases will need more safeguards and evaluation before deployment.</p>



<p>&#8220;While AI risk management can be started at any point in the project development,&#8221; Ayesha Gulley, an AI policy expert from Holistic AI,<a href="https://www.holisticai.com/blog/need-for-risk-management-in-ai"> said</a>. &#8220;Implementing a risk management framework sooner than later can help enterprises increase trust and scale with confidence.&#8221;</p>



<p>When you know the risks posed by different AI solutions, you can choose the level of access you&#8217;ll grant them to data and critical business systems.</p>



<p>In terms of regulations, the EU AI Act already distinguishes between AI systems with different risk levels, and NIST recommends assessing AI tools based on trustworthiness, social impact, and how humans interact with the system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Proactively set AI ethics governance</strong></h2>



<p>You don&#8217;t need to wait for AI regulations to set up ethical AI policies. Allocate responsibility for ethical AI considerations, put together teams, and draw up policies for ethical AI use that include cybersecurity, model validation, transparency, data privacy, and incident reporting.</p>



<p>Plenty of existing frameworks like NIST&#8217;s AI RMF and ISO/IEC 42001 recommend AI best practices that you can incorporate into your policies.</p>



<p>&#8220;Regulating AI is both necessary and inevitable to ensure ethical and responsible use. While this may introduce complexities, it need not hinder innovation,&#8221;<a href="https://minutehack.com/opinions/as-ai-regulation-looms-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation"> said Arik Solomon</a>, CEO and co-founder of Cypago. &#8220;By integrating compliance into their internal frameworks and developing policies and processes aligned with regulatory principles, companies in regulated industries can continue to grow and innovate effectively.&#8221;</p>



<p>Companies that can demonstrate a proactive approach to ethical AI will be better positioned for compliance. AI regulations aim to ensure transparency and data privacy, so if your goals align with these principles, you&#8217;ll be more likely to have policies in place that comply with future regulation. The<a href="https://fairnow.ai/"> FairNow</a> platform can help with this process, with tools for managing AI governance, bias checks, and risk assessments in a single location.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Don&#8217;t let fear of AI regulation hold you back</strong></h2>



<p>AI regulations are still evolving and emerging, creating uncertainty for businesses and developers. But don&#8217;t let the fluid situation stop you from benefiting from AI. By proactively implementing policies, workflows, and tools that align with the principles of data privacy, transparency, and ethical use, you can prepare for AI regulations and take advantage of AI-powered possibilities.</p>

<p>Did you know that effective asset management practices pose challenges for almost half of small businesses? According to the latest research, 43% of businesses either manually report their inventory or in a few cases, do not record assets in any manner.</p>



<p>However, asset management is not immune to the disruptive pressure of artificial intelligence (AI) currently revolutionising numerous industries. The manner in which corporations manage their tangible and intangible assets is undergoing a profound transformation due to the evolving technology of AI. This blog will discover how AI-driven<a href="https://newgensoft.com/solutions/business-functions/finance-accounting/fixed-asset/"> fixed asset software</a> softwares transform asset management and what the future holds for businesses embedding those innovations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction to fixed asset management and AI</h3>



<p>Fixed asset management is a critical feature for organisations to manage, control, and optimise the value of their physical assets. Assets can include everything from equipment and vehicles to home computer systems. Traditionally, manual asset management systems entail manual report maintenance and periodic audits, which can be time-consuming and susceptible to human error.</p>



<p>AI-driven fixed assets software offers a modern solution by automating diverse asset control factors. This guarantees accuracy, reduces administrative overhead, and increases an asset&#8217;s useful life, ultimately contributing to significant cost savings. AI, blended with the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and predictive analytics, is the primary method to develop smart, efficient, and scalable asset management solutions.</p>



<p>The predictive capacities of AI revolutionise proactive asset management. AI can predict when a piece of hardware is likely to fail or spot chances for optimisation by evaluating patterns and trends in data. The proactive strategy not only helps with strategic planning but also ensures the reliability of operations by preventing system outages that can cause serious disruptions to business operations and financial losses. Businesses may use AI to ensure their assets operate at peak efficiency, quickly adopt new technologies, and match operations to corporate goals.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AI&#8217;s advantages for fixed asset software</h3>



<p>AI-driven fixed asset software has numerous advantages for businesses, particularly in sectors where asset management is vital to daily operations, like production, healthcare, and logistics.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Greater effectiveness:</strong> Automation significantly speeds up asset tracking, control, and upkeep. As AI can assess huge amounts of information in real time, managers can respond immediately to determine the state of their assets.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cost savings: </strong>Ongoing asset utilisation and predictive analysis can result in lower operating costs. AI is capable of identifying underutilised or poorly functioning items, which may assist corporations in saving money by reallocating or disposal schedules.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Enhanced compliance and reporting:</strong> Staying compliant can be challenging with increasingly stringent regulatory governance. AI ensures that compliance reports are generated accurately and on time. Moreover, the software can routinely modify asset data to mirror regulatory changes, ensuring that companies consistently comply with laws.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Improved decision-making: </strong>With AI&#8217;s analytics capabilities, managers can make better choices about which assets to invest in, when to repair, and when to retire an asset. Selections are based on real-time information and predictive models instead of guesswork or manual calculations.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Case study: Predictive portfolio management precision issue:</h3>



<p>Predicting market trends and real-time portfolio optimisation was complicated for a top asset management company. Conventional approaches could not keep up with market demands, resulting in lost opportunities and less-than-ideal results.</p>



<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>



<p>The company was able to quickly evaluate large datasets by implementing an AI-powered predictive analytics system. The AI algorithms examined market patterns, assessed risk factors, and dynamically altered the portfolio. The end result was a notable improvement in portfolio performance and increased forecasting accuracy.</p>



<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A 20% boost in portfolio returns was attained.</li>



<li>Real-time market trend information improved decision-making.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The future of AI in asset management</h3>



<p>The future of asset management will revolutionise customer satisfaction, operational effectiveness, and decision-making. Below are the important elements that will transform asset management operations:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1) Elevated decision making</h4>



<p>By revealing hidden patterns from huge datasets, AI will permit asset managers to make better decisions. AI can evaluate the whole portfolio, compiling financial statistics and market news, which together will improve risk posture and portfolio formulation. AI will also make real-time adaptation feasible, preparing managers for future predictions and staying ahead of marketplace swings.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2) Automation and operational efficiency</h4>



<p>Robo-advisors will become necessary tools, autonomously managing tasks like portfolio rebalancing and standard operations. AI&#8217;s algorithmic training will execute decisions quickly, decreasing human intervention and cutting costs. AI will automate tedious back-office operations, including data entry and regulatory compliance procedures, ensuring smooth, streamlined workflows.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3) Client experience transformation</h4>



<p>In the future, client interactions will become customised and more responsive. AI will analyse purchaser information to provide tailored funding recommendations, and AI-powered chatbots will be available 24/7 to answer queries. The technology can even simplify reporting, turning complex economic information into easily digestible, jargon-free insights, building trust and transparency in customer relationships.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion:</h3>



<p>The future of asset management is undeniably tied to improvements in AI technology. AI-driven fixed asset software is already impacting asset monitoring, predictive analytics, and risk management by optimisation and automation. As hyper automation and IoT continue to adapt, the possibilities for remodeling asset management are limitless.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The intelligence displayed by generative AI chatbots like OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT has captured the imagination of individuals and corporations, and artificial intelligence has suddenly become the most exciting area of technology innovation.</p>



<p>AI has been recognised as a game changer, with potential to transform many aspects of our lives. From personalised medicine to autonomous vehicles, automated investments to digital assets, the possibilities enabled by AI seem endless.</p>



<p>But as transformational as AI will be, there are a lot of risks posed by this new technology. While fears about a malicious, Skynet-style AI system going rogue are misplaced, the dangers of AI centralisation are not. As companies like Microsoft, Google and Nvidia forge ahead in their pursuit of AI, fears about the concentration of power in the hands of just a few centralised players are becoming more pronounced.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why should we worry about decentralised AI?</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Monopoly power</strong></h3>



<p>The most pressing issue arising from centralised AI is the prospect of a few tech giants achieving<a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2024/01/18/the-looming-ai-monopolies-00136400"> monopolistic control</a> over the industry. The big tech giants have already accumulated a very significant market share in AI, giving them possession of vast amounts of data. They also control the infrastructure that AI systems run on, enabling them to stifle their competitors, hobble innovation, and perpetuate economic inequality.</p>



<p>By achieving a monopoly over the development of AI, these companies are more likely to have an unfair influence on regulatory frameworks, which they can manipulate to their advantage. It will mean that smaller startups, which lack the enormous resources of big tech giants, will struggle to keep up with the pace of innovation. Those that do survive and look like they might thrive will almost certainly end up being acquired, further concentrating power in the hands of the few. The result will be less diversity in terms of AI development, fewer choices for consumers, and less favourable terms, limiting the use-cases and economic opportunities promised by AI.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bias and Discrimination</strong></h3>



<p>Aside from monopolistic control, there are genuine fears around the<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/stories/2024/07/racism-and-ai-bias-past-leads-bias-future"> bias of AI systems</a>, and these concerns will take on more importance as society increasingly relies on AI.</p>



<p>The risk stems from the fact that organisations are becoming more reliant on automated systems to make decisions in many areas. It&#8217;s not unusual for a company to employ AI algorithms to filter job applicants, for example, and the risk is that a biased system could unfairly exclude a subset of candidates based on their ethnicity, age or location. AI is also used by insurance companies to set policy rates, by financial services firms to determine if someone qualifies for a loan and the amount of interest they&#8217;ll need to pay, and by law enforcement to determine which areas are more likely to see higher crime. In all of these use-cases, the potential implications of biased AI systems are extremely worrying.</p>



<p>Whether it&#8217;s law enforcement targeting minority communities, discriminatory lending practices or something else, centralised AI can potentially exacerbate social inequality and enable systemic discrimination.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Privacy and surveillance</strong></h3>



<p>Another risk posed by centralised AI systems is the lack of privacy protections. When just a few big companies control the vast majority of data generated by AI, they gain the ability to carry out unprecedented surveillance on their users. The data accumulated by the most dominant AI platforms can be used to monitor, analyse and predict an individual&#8217;s behaviour with incredible accuracy, eroding privacy and increasing the potential for the information to be misused.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s of particular concern in countries with authoritarian governments, where data can be weaponised to create more sophisticated tools for<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/13/1181868277/how-ai-is-revolutionising-how-governments-conduct-surveillance"> monitoring citizens</a>. But even in democratic societies, there is a threat posed by increased surveillance, as exemplified by the revelations of Edward Snowden about the US National Security Agency&#8217;s Prism program.</p>



<p>Corporations can also potentially misuse consumer&#8217;s data to increase their profits. In addition, when centralised entities accumulate vast amounts of sensitive data, this makes them more lucrative targets for hackers, increasing the risk of data leaks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Security risks</strong></h3>



<p>Issues of national security can also arise due to centralised AI. For instance, there are justified fears that AI systems can be<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01029-0"> weaponised</a> by nations, used to conduct cyberwarfare, engage in espionage, and develop new weapons systems. AI could become a key tool in future wars, raising the stakes in geopolitical conflicts.</p>



<p>AI systems themselves can also be targeted. As nations increase their reliance on AI, such systems will make for enticing targets, as they are obvious single points of failure. Take out an AI system and you could disrupt the entire traffic flow of cities, take down electrical grids, and more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ethics</strong></h3>



<p>The other major concern of centralised AI is about<a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/ethical-considerations-of-ai"> ethics</a>. That&#8217;s because the handful of companies that control AI systems would gain substantial influence over a society&#8217;s cultural norms and values, and might often prioritise profit, creating further ethical concerns.</p>



<p>For example, AI algorithms are already being used widely by social media platforms to moderate content, in an attempt to identify and filter out offensive posts. The worry is that algorithms, either by accident or design, might end up suppressing free speech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is already controversy about the effectiveness of AI-powered moderation systems, with numerous seemingly innocuous posts being blocked or taken down by automated algorithms. This leads to speculation that such systems are not broken but being manipulated behind the scenes based on the political narrative the platform is trying to promote.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The alternative? Decentralised AI</strong></h2>



<p>The only logical counterweight to centralised AI is the development of decentralised AI systems that ensure that control of the technology remains in the hands of the majority, rather than the few. By doing this, we can ensure that no single company or entity gains a significant influence over the direction of AI&#8217;s development.</p>



<p>When the development and governance of AI is shared by thousands or millions of entities, its progress will be more equitable, with greater alignment to the needs of the individual. The result will be more diverse AI applications, with an almost endless selection of models used by different systems, instead of a few models that dominate the industry.</p>



<p>Decentralised AI systems will also mean checks and balances against the risk of mass surveillance and manipulation of data. Whereas centralised AI can be weaponised and used in a way that&#8217;s contrary to the interests of the many, decentralised AI hedges against this kind of oppression.</p>



<p>The main advantage of decentralised AI is that everyone is in control over the technology&#8217;s evolution, preventing any single entity from gaining an outsized influence over its development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to decentralise AI</strong></h2>



<p>Decentralised AI involves a rethink of the layers that make up the AI technology stack, including elements like the infrastructure (compute and networking resources), the data, models, training, inference, and fine-tuning processes.</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t just put our hopes in open-source models if the underlying infrastructure remains fully centralised by cloud computing giants like Amazon, Microsoft and Google, for instance. We need to ensure that every aspect of AI is decentralised</p>



<p>The best way to decentralise the AI stack is to break it down into modular components and create markets around them based on supply and demand. One such example of how this can work is<a href="https://www.spheron.network/"> Spheron</a>, which has created a Decentralised Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) that anyone can participate in.</p>



<p>With Spheron&#8217;s DePIN, everyone is free to share their underutilised computing resources, essentially renting them out to those who need infrastructure to host their AI applications. So, a graphic designer who uses a powerful laptop with a GPU can donate processing power to the DePIN when they&#8217;re not using it for their own work, and be rewarded with token incentives.</p>



<p>What this means is that the AI infrastructure layer becomes widely distributed and decentralised, with no single provider in control. It&#8217;s enabled by blockchain technology and smart contracts, which provide transparency, immutability and automation.</p>



<p>DePIN can also work for open-source models and underlying data. For instance, it&#8217;s possible to share training datasets on a decentralised network like<a href="https://qubic.org/"> Qubic</a>, which will make sure the provider of that data is rewarded each time their information is accessed by an AI system.</p>



<p>To ensure access and permissions are decentralised, every part of the technology stack is distributed in this way. However, the AI industry currently struggles to provide such a level of decentralisation. Although open-source models have become extremely popular among AI developers, most people continue to rely on proprietary cloud networks, meaning the training and inference processes are heavily centralised.</p>



<p>But there are strong incentives for decentralisation to win out. One of the primary advantages of DePIN networks, for example, is that they help to reduce overheads. Because networks like Spheron don&#8217;t rely on intermediaires, participants don&#8217;t need to make any payments or share revenue with third-parties. Moreover, they can afford to be more competitive in terms of pricing than corporations that are under pressure to grow profitability.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Decentralisation must win</strong></h2>



<p>The future of AI holds a lot of potential, but it&#8217;s also perilous. While the capabilities of AI systems have improved dramatically in the last few years, most of the advances have been made by all-powerful companies and that has resulted in an increase in their influence over the industry. There&#8217;s a price to pay for this, not just in monetary terms.</p>



<p>The only reasonable alternative is to promote the greater adoption of decentralised AI, which can enhance accessibility and ensure a greater flexibility of AI. By allowing everyone to participate in the development of AI on an equal footing, we&#8217;ll see more diverse, interesting, and useful applications that can benefit everyone equally, as well as putting their users first.</p>



<p>Building a decentralised AI future will involve a great deal of coordination and collaboration across every layer of the AI stack. Fortunately, there are strong incentives for participants to do just that. And again, the incentives are not just monetary.</p>
